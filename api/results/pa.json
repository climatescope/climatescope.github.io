The government exempts clean power projects from paying value-added taxes and offers income tax credits equal to 25-50% of a project’s capex, depending its size. In February 2018, the Electric Transmission Company (ETESA) announced that, due to changes in the law, there will be no further tenders specifically to solicit bids from clean energy projects.
