dispute surrounding offshore wind tariffs awarded in 2012 has only recently been resolved – developers agreed to a 30% tariff cut. In September 2020, it became known that the government is seeking to shave some 600 million euros ($709 million) a year off feed-in tariffs awarded pre-2011. Although France has avoided the busts caused by retroactive cuts in other European markets, such moves reduce investor confidence even as the government targets ambitious renewables additions. Renewables additions have not reached high enough levels to warrant being curtailed, but local opposition and litigation are increasing. In response, the government enacted a range of measures to increase acceptance and overcome legal challenges over 2018-19."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The first two quarters of 2020 saw a leap in investment in clean energy to $6.7 billion, the highest level since 2011. That was largely the result of a jump in investment in offshore wind as the first projects reached financial close. Investment in PV has been constant over recent years while that in onshore wind has continued to grow. National champions Engie and EDF, which operate 5GW between them, are the top project owners by a sizeable margin. Japanese and German credit providers have made inroads in recent years, but domestic banks Crédit Agricole, BNP Paribas and Société Générale top the rankings for renewables lending."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"France has set itself ambitious technology-specific renewables targets through its 10-year roadmap, ratified in January 2020. This is underpinned by a net-zero target for 2050. An auction timeline extends to 2028 for most renewables technologies, and 10 or so rounds will be held each year. In addition, a feed-in tariff is now restricted to small-scale installations, although in October 2020 the government announced that it would raise the size limit for PV projects from 100kW to 500kW. France has committed to not building any additional fossil-fuel capacity, meaning renewables will dominate additions. This is especially relevant in light of the government’s plans to reduce the country’s dependence on nuclear – the technology’s generation share is to reach 50% by 2035, from 71% in 2019."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Opportunities revolve around the future of France’s nuclear fleet. As baseload power is reduced, renewables will be added in increasing volumes to fill the gaps. Security of supply might also be threatened as increasingly frequent heat waves make it harder to cool nuclear reactors. The government has planned to phase out its remaining 3GW of coal capacity by the end of 2022, and has pledged not to add any new gas capacity. As in other European markets, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding how the electrification of hard-to-abate sectors will impact demand. That said, France is one of the few countries where electricity, at over a third, accounts for a larger share of residential heat that any other technology."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"France’s power market is dominated by one of the world’s largest nuclear fleets – EDF’s 56 reactors accounted for more than two thirds of generation in 2019. The presence of an amortized nuclear fleet with low running costs has reduced the impetus for renewables. French reactors produce enough power to sell large volumes abroad, although it is expected to increasingly rely on imports as the nuclear fleet shrinks. Already, winter peaks cannot be met without importing power from abroad. The government is poised to restructure EDF to increase the utility’s financing capacity, potentially separating its nuclear arm from more profitable divisions. Meanwhile, it will decide whether to embark of a new wave of reactor building by mid-2023 – an unlikely prospect given the technology’s high cost."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"French renewables are pricey compared to those developed in neighboring markets. That has much to do with relatively low deployment levels and reams of red tape, which pushes up development costs. Among the European markets surveyed in the first quarter of 2020, France had Europe’s most expensive LCOE range for onshore wind after Poland, at $43-65/MWh. That said, a low strike price of 44 euros/MWh ($52/MWh) was registered for France’s first offshore wind auction in June 2019. France’s retail and wholesale power prices are set to rise, partly due to the cost of maintaining the country’s ageing nuclear reactor fleet while adding renewables. However, a lack of flexibility makes France among Europe’s most volatile power markets."}]}
