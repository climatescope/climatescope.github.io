Zealand is an open and transparent market for investors in renewable energy projects and electricity infrastructure. However, a lack of activity can make it difficult for perspective investors to find openings in the market. Soft demand growth, a large amount of renewable energy penetration and sufficient levels of existing generation capacity mean investors may struggle to find new opportunities in the market, despite favourable regulation. Government programs are unlikely to offer direct subsidies to push new renewable projects in the market in the near term."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Hydro and onshore wind generation have dominated clean energy investment in New Zealand to date, due to their favourable economics and an abundance of high-quality resources. A fully liberalized market has resulted in most investment coming from the private sector, catalyzed by supportive regulations and government targets. The bulk of generation in New Zealand is owned by a handful of utilities: Contact Energy, Mercury Energy, Genesis Energy, Meridian Energy and TrustPower."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"New Zealand has a target of 90% renewable electricity (including large hydro) by 2025, in an average hydrological year. While this target is ambitious when compared to many of its peer countries, an abundance of hydro generation means New Zealand is already supplying around 85% of electricity from zero carbon sources. To achieve its target, the government’s primary strategy is to remove any barriers to renewable energy investment and support nascent clean energy industries, such as geothermal, biomass and marine power. Due to the country’s heavy reliance on hydro, and limited amounts of dam storage, it is likely fossil fuel generators will remain in the system to provide security of supply, particularly during periods of low rainfall."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity demand in New Zealand has been largely flat over the past decade, despite economic growth and increasing electrification in various sectors of the economy. However, in order to keep carbon emissions within its current Paris Agreement commitments and net-zero by 2050 targets, greater electrification of transport, heating and industry is expected to drive up electricity demand over the longer term. It’s relatively small land mass and extensive network infrastructure mean there is little need for substantial electrification, or micro-grid programs, although the falling costs of decentralized energy may see a rise in these type of projects in the future."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Wholesale spot prices in New Zealand are relatively volatile, largely depending on local rainfall levels - periods of drought lead to highly elevated spot prices. Increased transmission and distribution costs have also placed upwards pressure on retail power prices around the country over the past two decades, although final retail rates are still on the lower end of comparable OECD countries."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Hydro generation accounts for around 60% of New Zealand’s electricity supply, bringing the total supply from renewable energy to around 85%. The country aims to further increase the share of generation from renewables in the years ahead as part of its ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050. With such a high reliance on hydro power, more investment in variable renewables will require additional firming technology – generation that operates counter to hydro seasons – or storage assets, in particular to deal with periods of extended drought. At this stage New Zealand does not have any specific mechanism to force new renewables or firming capacity into the system. It instead relies on established market signals and private investment to facilitate the required low carbon technologies."}]}
