are few legal barriers to entry into the Danish power market, shown by the fact that there are several hundred local generators and around 50 suppliers active in the market. There is, for example, no local content rules to develop renewables projects onshore or offshore. However, the country promotes community ownership and has put an obligation on developers to offer 20% ownership for onshore wind farms taller than 20 meters to nearby communities. Denmark also has a cap on onshore wind turbines to be installed in the country by 2030 (1,850 turbines). This will require the number of turbines installed to approximately halve from today's installations. Since many of the onshore wind turbines in Denmark are old and relatively small, these could be replaced with fewer, higher capacity turbines to limit the impact of this cap on installed onshore wind capacity."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Denmark's clean energy sector attracted $16.7 billion of investment from 2010-2019 (excluding acquisitions) but this total was not spread evenly throughout the period, with bumper years in 2011, 2014 and 2016. The main reason for the uneven distribution is the timing of financing for major wind projects. BNEF has tracked a total of $9.8 billion invested in the wind sector between 2004 and 2019, while solar PV received $3 billion in the same period. That was largely due to a boom in 2012, however, driven by a net metering scheme. Biomass and waste is the second-largest sector in terms of investment. The sector is important to Denmark's distributed heat sector and has been a popular fuel switching option for coal power plants (which must be phased out by 2030), and attracted investments worth $3.6 billion in the 2004-2019 period."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Denmark is characterized by a bipartisan and almost unilateral energy policy, which has survived several changes in government and energy market trends. The country has committed to achieving 100% renewable electricity supply by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Denmark has already met its legally binding 2020 renewable energy goal, with a 36% share of renewables in final energy consumption in 2018 compared to a 30% target. Denmark has two major auction schemes for renewable energy projects: a technology-neutral auction scheme (mainly for onshore wind and PV) and a separate tender scheme for offshore wind. Denmark encourages developers to offer nearby communities at least a 20% stake in onshore wind farms taller than 20 meters and has put a limit on the number of onshore wind turbines to be installed in the country by 2030."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The business environment for renewables is positive in Denmark as the country is actively pushing to increase clean generation. A bipartisan agreement on energy policy has ensured policy certainty for decades. There have only been a few PPAs signed with corporate offtakers, as developers instead opt for the feed-in-premium scheme for onshore wind with little scope to develop offshore outside of auctions. Nonetheless, deals are slowly growing in size, with around 120MW of wind having received a corporate PPA in 2018, while 250MW of solar secured a corporate PPA in 2019. The power market is decentralized with a strong coupling to the heat sector. More than half of the country's heat supply comes from district heating, of which more than 80% is co-produced with power."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Denmark shares a wholesale power market with Norway, Sweden and Finland, but has a separate and sovereign energy policy. The country is split into two power price zones. Wind power is the dominant source for electricity, accounting for 49% of generation in 2019. The country has been committed to build out wind capacity for decades and now aims to reach 100% renewable electricity by 2030, which will include launching two 2GW offshore wind 'islands'. Increasing renewables penetration has led to concerns over security of supply, particularly in east Denmark. There was a plan to implement a strategic reserve to combat this, but this was postponed when it became clear that the European Commission would reject it as it was likely to be in breach of state aid rules. More recent reviews conducted by the system operator from 2019-2020 suggest that there is no longer a need for a strategic reserve so the plans are shelved until 2030. Instead, the country has decided to put more focus on flexibility and interconnection capacity."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Wholesale power prices in Denmark are low, which has led to some concerns about a lack of investment in new firm capacity. This is a characteristic of all NordPool markets, which are dominated by low short-run marginal cost electricity sources like hydro and wind. In 2019, the average day-ahead baseload power price was 38.94 euros/MWh – 5 euros lower than the EU average but just above the price in neighboring Sweden. Despite this, the average household retail price in 2019 was 295.40 euros/MWh, the second highest in the EU behind only Germany. Most of the retail price comes from levies and taxes, of which the renewable public service obligation (PSO) accounts for more than half. As a result, Denmark agreed to phase out the PSO tariff by 2021 in order to reduce electricity costs for consumers while the government gradually shifts the financing of renewable energy subsidies over to the state budget."}]}
