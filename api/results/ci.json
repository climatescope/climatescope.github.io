the grid-connected electricity market, only generation is open to private participation. Rules for interconnection are worked out on an ad-hoc basis with CIE. The CIE single-buyer status poses a direct barrier to the construction of mini-grids to electrify rural areas. Some 96 sites have been identified as suitable for the location of mini-grids for rural electrification (by the Rural Electrification program PDER), but it is illegal for third parties to operate them. An increasing number of mini-grids are also being integrated into the main grid as rural electrification improves in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Grid-connected capacity in Côte d’Ivoire is provided by 1,350MW of gas and 879MW of hydro. The gas generators are mostly owned by independent power producers, while the hydro assets are state-owned and operated by the CIE (Compagnie Ivorienne d’Electricite).  Clean energy investments to date (other than hydro) include two solar projects agreed in 2018 and 2019 respectively: 37MW partially funded by the German development bank (KfW) and the EU, and a 60MW project under Scaling Solar, an IFC initiative. The cost of the first solar plant is estimated to be around 40 million euros ($47 million), of which 27 million euros will be provided by KfW and 9 million euros by the EU."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Côte d’Ivoire’s clean energy policy consists of several targets, including 42% renewable energy generation by 2030. Some 26% is intended to come from mid- and large-scale hydro, with the remaining 16% from other renewables. Today, the country generates 67% of electricity from natural gas, with the remainder generated by hydropower. To date, it has made no progress in its non-hydro renewable energy targets, with the exception of 37MW of solar projects announced in 2018 and 60MW announced a year later. There is also controversy around a planned 700MW coal power plant by 2024 – equivalent to about 30% of the country’s installed capacity today. The 2014 electricity code provides a legal framework for renewable electricity production but there are no other concrete laws or measures in place."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Côte d’Ivoire’s electricity sector is growing. Peak power increased from 912MW in 2010 to 1,443MW in 2019, and electricity exports from 470GWh in 2010 to 1,255GWh in 2019.  Its power network is one of the largest in West Africa, with more than 54,000km of network in total. Today, 70% of its population have access to electricity and 69% of municipalities have been electrified. The 2014 Electricity Code provides a framework for the distribution of renewable energy by independent producers, although this is currently forbidden because of the concession contract between CIE and the state, in place until 2020."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Côte d’Ivoire’s power market is only open to private participation for generation. CIE has a government concession to run the state-owned generation assets and the transmission and distribution assets until 2020. The CIE also has single buyer status, which makes bilateral electricity contracts and independent mini-grids illegal, and forces independent power producers to sell electricity back to it. Almost 60% of the 2,229MW of installed capacity is provided by independent gas power plants, with the remainder from hydro. The government has identified 30 sites with a total hydro capacity of 1,684MW to be developed in the coming years. Potential increases in capacity could come from around 100MW of solar projects, agreed in 2018 and 2019, and a 700MW coal power plant to be commissioned by 2024."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity tariffs are regulated by ANARE for all sectors. Some large customers are eligible for special tariffs, as was the case with the Societé Ivoirienne du Raffinage. Tariffs have a fixed component depending on the maximum power required by the user. Residential and low voltage commercial users have two default options for their required power. In addition, industrial users face time-of-use tariffs with three differentiated periods, while small users have a fixed charge per kWh. Power producers are forced to sell their electricity to CIE. Take-or-pay contracts are common and they are calculated  on an individual basis in order to be profitable to the producer. There is little flexibility outside of this standardized method."}]}
