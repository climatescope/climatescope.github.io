major barriers to solar in Nigeria are financial, from debt availability to credit risk and foreign exchange hedges. Many developers in Nigeria wish that import tariffs were reduced and clean energy products prioritized at the ports. A proposed 'Zero Percent Import Duty for Renewable Energy Technologies' calls for a five-year import duty and VAT exemption on renewable-energy technologies, particularly solar components, which are most prominent in Nigeria. Currency-conversion risks are also substantial. Revenue for most solar projects is in Nigerian naira, which international developers need to convert to foreign currency. The Central Bank of Nigeria allocates U.S. dollars to local banks, but applies restrictions on converting naira into U.S. dollars. This poses a huge risk, particularly if a company holds U.S. dollar-denominated debt. As a result, the market is dominated mostly by local players that are more comfortable with owning naira. Currently, PV modules must pay a 5% import duty plus 5% VAT. Batteries are taxed a total of 27.5%, made up of 20% import duty and 7.5% VAT."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) is now commissioning projects under its Energizing Education Program (EEP), providing power for nine universities (seven will run on PV and two on gas) with funding for phase I ($29.7 million) coming from Nigeria's sovereign green bond issued in 2017. The REA secured a further $350 million loan through the World Bank and $200 million (from the AfDB) for the Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP), totaling $550 million. EEP phase 2 (19MW of PV) will receive $105 million of this fund. Under the NEP, $150 million is dedicated to implementing a results-based financing program through a performance-based grant (PBG) and minimum subsidy tender mechanism for helping developers finance solar hybrid mini-grids. In the commercial mini-grid segment, Rensource, a three-year-old off-grid solar energy firm, has raised $20 million in a Series A round equity funding jointly led by African venture capital fund CRE Venture Capital and impact investor Omidyar Network in December 2019. The round also saw participation from Inspired Evolution, Proparco, EDPR, I&P, Sin Capital, and Yuzura Honda. Rensource’s funding round follows sustained investor interest in Africa-focused off-grid and renewable energy startups seeking to plug electricity gaps. In June 2019, Arnergy, another solar mini-grid company, also raised $9 million in its Series A round equity funding."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Nigeria has a handful of clean energy policies, including an ambitious target to achieve 30 gigawatts of power generation by 2030, of which 30% is expected to come from renewables. The country’s failure to provide a stable electricity grid has created a fertile environment for the decentralized off-grid PV sector to develop. In 2017, Nigeria introduced supportive mini-grid regulation, making it easier for developers to build projects of 100kW to 1MW in size. BNEF estimates that there are 20 megawatts of distributed-PV installed to-date. Projects with capacity in excess of 1MW often require time-consuming approvals, such as a generator license. In the on-grid space, the 14 PV developers that signed utility-scale PPAs in 2016 have stalled, due to discrepancies in guarantees or risk measures that the government needs to make, with no certainty as to when or if these will actually be built."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Nigeria has a very strong solar resource, followed by up to 3.5GW of small hydro. There is little wind resource. In 2016 alone, Nigerians spent a massive $16 billion to power privately-owned diesel/gasoline generators. More than 60% of companies in Nigeria have access to, or rely heavily on, diesel generators, compared to less than 20% in South Africa. The potential for minigrids in Nigeria is therefore substantial. The on-grid peak demand reported by the government was 26GW in 2019, but actual demand, accounting for off-grid consumption, is likely to be well over 50GW. In 2016, Nigeria announced the Power Sector Recovery Program (PSRP), a series of policy actions, operational, governance and financial interventions to be implemented by the Federal Government of Nigeria between 2017 and 2022, in order to reset the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) for future growth. The World Bank Group expressed its willingness to assist the PSRP with a $2.6 billion loan in 2019 and as of June 2020, $750 million had been approved."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Nigeria has no non-hydro renewable energy installed on-grid. Of the 13.5GW total capacity, 84.6% is accounted for by natural gas, 14.5% large hydro, 0.7% off-grid small hydro and 0.2% off-grid distributed PV. Only 7.5GW of the installed capacity is actually available, of which Nigeria generates an annual average of around 3.5 to 4.5GW of electricity. Generation is fully privatized, transmission is government-owned, and distribution is private but with only 11 regional players. Nigeria aims to create an enabling environment for increasing grid capacity. As of April 2018, distributors must provide metered billing as opposed to the estimated billing system previously in place, in accordance with new Meter Asset Provider (MAP) regulation. The regulation states that a minimum of 30% of contracted meters must come from local manufacturers. As a results, President Buhari imposed a 35% import levy on ‘Fully Built Unit’ meters. This has been waived as of August 2020 since it makes it difficult for the MAP to be carried out effectively due to lack of local manufacturers."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices are set by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) under its multi-year tariff-order model. Distribution companies have said that the tariffs are not cost-reflective, and so investment has stagnated. Tariffs had not been updated since 2015 and so do not incorporate the significant drop in the price of solar that has occurred worldwide. However, on December 31, 2019, NERC disclosed its plans to immediately review electricity tariffs in the country from January 1, which was to take place April 1, 2020. But this has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is a service-based tariff (SBT) where areas that receive over 12 hours of service (power) per day in a month will pay the higher tariff. NERC says this is to protect the poorer population, such that the richest 10% will cover up to 50% of the price hike. The ‘yet-to-be-built’ on-grid PV projects partially ‘agreed’ a tariff of $0.075-0.115/kWh, which falls within BNEF’s global utility-scale fixed-axis PV LCOE range ($0.07-0.212/kWh, 1H 2020). No wholesale power market exists yet in Nigeria. Instead, NBET brokers transactions between generators and distributors. The ‘Eligible Customer’ regulation allows bulk buyers to buy directly from a generator at a negotiated PPA rate. In 2018, BNEF carried out a detailed study about on-site solar in Nigeria and found that solar on commercial and industrial premises can cost between $0.1-0.2/kWh in Nigeria. PV alone is already cheaper than grid electricity tariffs or electricity from a diesel generator, which typically costs $0.28-0.32/kWh. Though for isolated residential-based solar hybrid mini-grids, BNEF’s recent State of Global State Minigrids report found the LCOEs of minigrids in Nigeria to have a huge range, reaching $0.5-1.46/kWh."}]}
