further retroactive subsidy cuts in the Czech Republic are now banned by the EU. However, the general public is still paying out to previous renewables support schemes, even though they closed to all but small hydro in 2014. In 2016, the cost of this support amounted to 1.4 billion euros, based on BNEF analysis. More generally, the most problematic factors to doing business in the Czech Republic are inefficient bureaucracy, tax regulations and, to a lesser extent, corruption, according to the World Economic Forum. The Czech government has pledged to cut red tape and application processing times for renewables."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Almost three quarters of new clean energy investment from 2004-2019 went to solar projects, totaling $5.5 billion. The Czech Republic saw a peak of $2.8 billion invested in 2010, although retroactive subsidy cuts brought funding levels crashing down, with financing plummeting to an average of less than $50 million a year between 2011 and 2019, among the lowest level in the EU. European commercial banks have been responsible for most loans to renewables projects, with Erste Group Bank and Commerzbank topping the list. In addition to dominating the power market as a whole, state-owned CEZ is the biggest renewables asset owner in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The Czech Republic does not currently offer any support mechanism to new renewables projects. A short-lived renewables boom ended in 2011 when the government imposed a retroactive tax on solar projects to limit returns and lengthen the payback period. Further laws in 2012-2013 effectively put a moratorium on further deployment, with renewables additions averaging 30MW a year since then. Since 2014, only new small-scale hydro projects have been eligible for support. Nevertheless, the Czech Republic achieved its 2020 renewable energy target seven years ahead of schedule, which affirms that the original goal was not very ambitious. For 2030, the country has targeted a 22% share of renewables in final energy consumption – which is below the Commission’s recommendation of at least 23%. A commission to formulate the country’s eventual move away from coal was established in March 2019, and is expected to launch a phase-out plan by the end of 2020."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity demand growth has been sluggish since 2000, rising by a compound annual rate of less than 1% – and it is not due to accelerate over the next decade. Onshore wind potential is limited by land availability and public acceptance issues. The 2030 strategy prioritizes biomass and energy-from-waste, and so these technologies may offer more opportunity for both electricity and heat. As such, the State Energy Policy prioritizes biomass (subject to food-security limits) alongside wind and solar (for small-scale systems). The role of gas is focused around CHP plants and offering flexibility services in the electricity sector."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The electricity sector was liberalized in 2006 but remains fairly concentrated, with CEZ accounting for more than two thirds of generation. Both CEZ and CEPS (the transmission system operator) are likely to remain state-owned for the foreseeable future. CEZ owns and operates the two nuclear power plants, which account for around a third of generation. This share is due to expand over the coming decades due to strong government and public support, a wish to boost energy independence (away from reliance on Russian gas) and a need to replace lost capacity through phase-out of its aging coal fleet. Potential challenges will be deciding how to finance new reactors and mitigating anti-nuclear pressure from some of its EU neighbors. The generation mix is likely to remain diversified as the national strategy does not allow any one technology to provide more than 65% of generation."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Wholesale power prices in the Czech Republic have followed the overall EU downward trend. The country benefits from being well interconnected to its neighbors. Retail prices for all types of customer are also relatively low compared with surrounding EU countries, suggesting little impetus for households to install small-scale PV or corporates to undertake power-purchase agreements. While it is the third-largest net electricity exporter in the EU, concerns about energy independence have dominated discussions about phasing out coal. The country is also highly dependent on imported crude oil and gas, with almost all of its imported gas coming from Russia. The country wishes to diversify its gas supply, but has yet to clarify how this will be achieved – contracts with Russia’s Gazprom extend until 2035."}]}
