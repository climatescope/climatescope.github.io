and financial risk is relatively low in the U.K. compared to other EU countries and the U.S., according to Bloomberg's country risk assessment. Despite this, uncertainty following the 2016 referendum to leave the EU became a barrier to general investment conditions. The U.K. has closed subsidy programs earlier than planned and reduced support rates, but it does not have a history of major retroactive policy changes in the same way as several southern European countries do. Routes to market for new renewables projects can also be challenging. The government tightened rules around planning and permitting renewables projects, in particular for onshore wind farms. Of the three CfD rounds that have allocated capacity to date, only one has awarded CfDs to onshore wind and PV, and that was in 2015. The more recent rounds have been open exclusively to less mature renewable energy technologies like offshore wind. Mounting public pressure for the government to revise its policy around onshore wind has yet to create material policy change. The government also wants to strengthen the domestic supply chain for offshore wind but has not yet done so through local content requirements."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"New clean energy investment in the U.K. has stagnated since 2017 due to renewables policy changes and Brexit uncertainty. Annual investment averaged $8.3 billion between 2017 and 2019, compared to an annual average of $20.1 billion from 2013-2016.  The role of the European Investment Bank now that the country has left the EU poses significant concern to future investment. The organization is the U.K.'s top asset finance lead arranger – accounting for one tenth of the country's total clean energy investment from 2004-2018. Investment figures in the U.K. – as in several northern European countries – are shaped by offshore wind auctions: the sector reached a new record of $15 billion in 2016 after the second CfD round and 2020 is set to follow suit following the third CfD round. In the long term, BNEF expects costs for new onshore wind and PV projects to more than halve between 2017 and 2050, thanks to technology improvements and production cost reductions. However, investment in new-build renewables could struggle as other technologies receive capacity payments."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The U.K. power policy landscape has changed significantly in the last five years, as the government has sought to minimize public spending on incentive schemes for renewables. The Renewables Obligation certificate program ended for onshore wind and PV a year earlier than planned and closed its doors to the remaining technologies in 2017. The feed-in tariff was also put on the chopping block. Now, the only substantial support available for large renewables projects is through the Contract-for-Difference (CfD) auction scheme. The government has focused the CfD scheme on delivering support for offshore wind. A sector deal for the offshore wind industry released in 2019 promises to deliver at least 30GW by 2030 - and the government has more recently promised to increase this target to 40GW. In 2019, the U.K. increased the ambition of its emissions reduction targets by legislating for a net-zero emissions reduction goal by 2050. Beyond renewables, the government also seems committed to nuclear power and has announced its sector deal in June 2018. However, it has struggled to attract investment for the substantial pipeline of new-build nuclear assets. After a costly deal was signed with EDF to complete Hinkley Point C, the government is having to rethink how it incentivizes investment to new nuclear plants."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Government focus is on offshore wind out of all the renewables technologies on offer, due to the good resource potential for the technology in the U.K. In 2019, the government put forward a 'sector deal' to achieve 30GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030, which requires an additional 10GW of new capacity. The government has since tentatively pledged that it will increase this target to 40GW by 2030. Meanwhile, U.K. power demand declined 6.8% from 2010-2019. BNEF expects a small average rise in power demand of 0.1% each year between 2020 and 2050, as efficiency gains are offset by the ramp-up in demand from electric vehicles. However, meeting net-zero emissions by 2050 could require further reliance on the electrification of other sectors like heating for buildings."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The U.K. has two electricity markets: one for England, Wales and Scotland; and the Integrated Single Electricity Market (I-SEM) covering the whole island of Ireland. In Great Britain, the 'Big Six' (British Gas, EDF, Eon, RWE npower, Scottish Power and SSE) hold a majority share of the generation and retail segments of the market, but this picture is rapidly changing as new entrants arrive to compete. Security-of-supply concerns in the 2010s prompted the government to implement a capacity market. This guarantees a sufficient reserve margin, but is costly compared to reserves. It could also discourage decarbonization and lead to lock-in of existing generators. More than half of U.K. power generation is fueled by fossil fuels and nuclear, but this is rapidly changing. The country's carbon price floor has been effective in reducing coal generation, and the government plans to close all remaining coal-fired power stations by October 2024. By 2050, BNEF expects just over half of U.K. electricity to be generated by wind farms, and another third by PV, driven by declining renewables costs."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices have remained relatively stable at between 38-50 pounds/MWh over the past decade, with the most important drivers of U.K. power prices being gas (and in the past, coal) prices. The U.K. has relatively high wholesale electricity prices compared with the rest of the EU because the country has a carbon price floor and only 3GW of interconnector capacity with mainland Europe and 4GW overall. Interconnection capacity represented just 6.5% of peak demand in 2018, compared to 33% in Germany and 20% in Spain, making the U.K. less flexible than its European counterparts. The country is a net-importer of power, but limited interconnection means that it cannot benefit as much from the low prices in France and Germany. In the long term, BNEF expects U.K. baseload wholesale power prices to face structural decline out to 2030 in nominal terms, amid pressure from wind and solar. These technologies are already cheaper to build than new gas plants."}]}
