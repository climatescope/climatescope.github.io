has limited barriers to develop renewable energy projects in the country. It is open to foreign investment and presents no off-taker risk as the wealthy Qatari government guarantees projects. Transmission constraints are non-existent, which limit curtailment risk. Indexation of the riyal and the dollar removes currency risk. Finding a suitable plot of land could however present a major challenge for renewable projects. Other barriers are minor, such as imported equipment being taxed and project developers being required to build the electric infrastructure to connect projects to the grid."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Qatar reached financial close of the 800MW Siraj-1 solar PV project with 1.7 billion Qatari riyal ($456 million) in 2020. The country welcomes foreign investment by allowing investment in renewable energy projects to come from anywhere but must not solely be from Qatari banks. Qatar also established Qatar Solar, a 100% owned holding company formed by Qatar Foundation, to specifically invest in solar technologies, new applications of solar and solar research opportunities."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Qatar aims to generate 2% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2022, and intends to increase that share to 20% by 2030. It is betting on solar projects to achieve the targets, with 800MW solar PV projects being built to support power supply for the 2022 FIFA World Cap, and an early ambition to deploy 10GW of solar power capacity in the country by 2030. The target is very ambitious, given that it is equal to the country’s 2019 installed capacity from all sources."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Qatar’s peak power demand is growing at approximately 7%. The rate varies year-to-year with a range of 1-11%. Generation capacity continues to increase as load grows at 6.5% per year, which leads to expansion of transmission and distribution networks. This demand growth is primarily driven by growth of the country’s industrial sector and increasing infrastructure development for FIFA World Cap 2022. Abundant sunlight means solar PV projects have the greatest potential to help Qatar reduce its dependence on natural gas."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Natural gas accounts for over 99% of Qatar’s power generation. The installed generation capacity continues to increase as load grows at 6.5% per year. Renewables – primarily solar projects – are set to replace some generation to save gas from being burned for power, as exporting the gas as LNG has more value. Only power generation is liberalized in Qatar, and only Strategic National Investors can participate. Transmission and distribution are completely controlled by the national utility Kahramaa, which does not own generation assets."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Like other countries in the region, electricity prices in Qatar are heavily subsidized. The country is also the last among its peers that offers free electricity to its nationals. The levelized cost of electricity remains low, because natural gas, the primary source for power generation in Qatar, is abundant, and only 7% of natural gas is burnt to generate power. Tariff was increased for expatriates only in 2015.  With an absolute monarch dependent on citizen support, Qatar appears comfortable giving citizens unlimited free utility services."}]}
