potential, especially for PV, is high in the West Bank and Gaza, but in practice Israel's role in the Palestinian Territories is a barrier to renewables development. The importation of components to the Gaza Strip requires military authorization, and critical shortages of land make rooftop PV the only practical solution. In the West Bank, PV installations have been subject to demolition or confiscation by the Israeli military in cases where building permits are disputed. Offtaker risk is also an issue as retailers operate at a loss, and PETL, the TSO that purchases electricity from Israel, remains in debt to Israel Electric Co."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment into the Palestinian Territories so far has been limited, with available funds coming from international development organizations and other countries, especially in the Persian Gulf. The Palestine Investment Fund, or PIF, and the Arab Bank are financing a $20 million solar portfolio to be developed in the West Bank."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The government of the Palestinian Territories has prioritized renewable energy as a means of meeting growing demand and circumventing limitations on land use and access. However, its 2020 goal of 130MW of renewables capacity is too ambitious, as just 9MW had been installed as of 2019. While a feed-in tariff and net metering scheme are designed to incentivize rooftop solar, limited progress has been made to date. Palestine does not have any currently operational large-scale power plants and thus relies on electricity imports, mainly from Israel. The emphasis on renewables is considered a means of achieving greater energy independence."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has remained stable in the past few years. The unreliability of the electricity supply in the Gaza Strip, where most consumers rely on diesel generators, offers opportunities – still, doing business is difficult as imports and entry are controlled by Israel. In the West Bank, the potential for PV uptake is significant but in practice it is limited as the most promising area for development is under the control of the Israeli military."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Installed generating capacity in Palestine is concentrated in one large-scale diesel-fired plant in the Gaza Strip, and some small-scale solar projects. The Gaza Power Plant has not been operational for long periods due to fuel shortages, although fuel supplied by Qatar began powering the plant from October 2018. The country still relies heavily on electricity imports, mostly from Israel and also from Egypt and Jordan. There are plans to add more domestic generation capacity, including a 455MW CCGT plant. Renewables uptake is also meant to reduce reliance on imports."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity in the Palestinian Territories is expensive compared to its neighbors, at an average retail price of $157/MWh. Most power is imported from Israel, and Palestinian consumers pay the same retail prices as set by the Israel Electric Co., despite the higher standard of living in Israel compared to Palestine. Power prices are determined by the regulator, and although they are high, Palestinian distribution companies (which are also the retailers) are unable to fully recoup their costs. Consumers are able to install rooftop solar panels, and high power prices incentivize their uptake."}]}
