and financial risk are low in Sweden, according to Bloomberg's country risk assessment. The government's clean energy policy is stable and provides visibility out to 2040, although there are unanswered questions around the support mechanisms with the discontinuation of the certificate scheme 10 years before. The volatility of electricity certificate prices and low wholesale power prices do make the Swedish market more challenging for investors, but corporate PPAs have been one way to overcome this issue in the short term. However, it is unclear if the PPA market will be deep enough to support the required investment in capacity to reach the 100% renewable electricity target."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"New clean energy investment in Sweden averaged $2.3 billion a year over 2012-19, with about three-quarters on average going to the onshore wind sector. Sweden's biggest renewables asset finance deal was for an 844MW onshore wind project in 2019, amounting to $1.097 billion, with NORD/LB and DNB acting as financial advisers. In May 2020, Enercon sold 25% of the project to Credit Suisse Energy Infrastructure Partners for an undisclosed amount, with DNB acting as financial adviser to the seller. The country's top lead arranger for renewables has been Australian financial group Macquarie, which was responsible for $2.523 billion over 2012-19. The largest power purchase agreement (PPA) in the country was signed in November 2017 with Norsk Hydro for the output of 483MW from the Markbygden Pitea Ett Wind Farm, making this deal the world’s largest at the time, and the third-largest corporate PPA to date."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Sweden has an ambitious long-term goal of 100% renewable energy by 2040. Renewable projects in Sweden are supported by an electricity certificate scheme, which provides producers with a revenue stream supplementing income from selling power to the grid. Norway joined the scheme in 2012. The scheme will likely exceed its 46.4TWh target next year, but has struggled with oversupply, which has led to low prices, reaching a record low of 1.9 euros/MWh in September 2020. Thus, the program will close to new entrants on January 1, 2022, and end in 2035. The quota for RECs will be slightly lowered in 2021, from 28.8% to 26.3%. Supply of RECs will also decrease, as the early projects eligible for green certificates reach the end of the 15-year compensation period."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Sweden is one of Europe's leading markets for corporate PPAs, which provide an additional incentive for renewables growth. Strong natural resources, a stable and credible incentive program and a national renewables commitment have all contributed to Sweden's dominant role in the European market. Corporate PPAs also hedge against the potential for higher wholesale power prices, which may increase in Sweden if the capacity gap created by nuclear decommissioning is not addressed."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Sweden has the highest share of zero-carbon energy in the EU, mainly thanks to its 16.2GW of installed hydropower, and has already achieved its 2020 renewable energy target of 49%. The government has an ambitious long-term goal of 100% renewable energy by 2040, so it will continue to add clean energy capacity while it has pushed the state-owned utility Vattenfall to abandon any activity in the coal sector. Sweden's parliament voted in 2020 against restarting the Ringhals 2 reactor, and Ringhals 1 is set to close at the end of 2020. This leaves six nuclear reactors with a combined 6.9GW of capacity that are set to operate until the end of their lifetimes. Sweden is divided into four areas with different power prices that reflect local supply and demand balances. Prices can vary significantly across areas due to grid congestion."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"High renewables penetration means that power prices in Sweden are relatively low, with 62% of installed capacity from zero-marginal-cost wind and hydro. In particular, power prices in 2020 have reached record lows, averaging a mere 10 euros/MWh. Its electricity grid is also highly interconnected with other countries, including Poland, Germany, Estonia and the Netherlands, making it easier to balance the grid. Sweden enjoys the lowest LCOE for onshore wind in the EMEA region, at $37/MWh in 1H 2020. Capex costs continue falling, and many Swedish wind projects are large enough to take advantage of economies of scale and enjoy one of the highest capacity factors in Europe."}]}
