barriers to developing renewables in the Dominican Republic are relatively low. An incentive regime for the development of clean energy has been in place since May 2007, consistent with the national energy plan (the Plan Energético Nacional, or PEN). It includes an investment tax credit, external financing, tax reductions, and exemptions from taxes and import duties for industrialized goods and services. Renewable energy generators have dispatch priority and open access to transmission and distribution. However, the financial instability of the Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales (CDEEE) and the subsidization of retail electricity prices both jeopardize project developers seeking financing. Lower power rates have also made it challenging for new energy technologies to thrive."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The Dominican Republic’s clean energy sector attracted $1.5 billion of investment over 2010-2019. Wind captured the bulk of it, $764 million, followed by solar with $438 million. Over half the investment was recorded 2017-2018. In 2019, investment dropped to $138 million from $405 million the year prior. Most of the country’s renewable energy projects to date have been financed by project developers and multilateral investment banks. Commercial banks have had limited participation."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The Dominican Republic has set a target to get 25% of its electricity from clean sources by 2025. As of December 2019, 11% of the 5.7 TWh the country had consumed during the year was accounted for by clean generation. The Dominican Republic also has in place a net metering program, which allows retail electricity customers with rooftop solar to be compensated through credits on their bills for sending surplus generation back to the grid."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"In 2019, the Dominican Republic’s electrification rate was 97.8% and demand for power in the country has grown briskly over a decade. Specifically, peak power demand jumped 38%, from 1,810MW in 2010 to 2,506MW in 2019, while average annual generation grew 42% over the same period. In January, 2019, the country’s National Energy Commission (CNE) published some details on how it plans for clean energy auctions to be executed. While national and international companies are allowed to participate, further details on how they will do so are not yet available. In May 2019, CNE authorized 12 provisional concessions for potentially 874MW capacity. The government also announced that month that it will invest $900 million in clean energy projects. However, as of November 2020, no further details on how those funds would be disbursed had been published."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Dominican Republic had 7.4GW of installed capacity in 2019, compared to 6.4GW in 2018. Oil, diesel and coal are the main sources of electricity, accounting for 5.2GW, or approximately 71% of total capacity. Small hydro, wind, solar and biomass together account for 12%. Although generation is open to private players, it remains dominated by state-owned entities. The distribution segment is divided into three public companies: Edeeste, Edenorte and Edesur. All state-owned companies are managed by the Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales (CDEEE)."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The annual average Dominican Republic residential power price dropped by a massive 35% in 2019 from the year prior, to $86.42/MWh. Commercial prices also were down, from $176.60/MWh in 2018 to $167.78/MWh. Average industrial prices decreased only slightly, to $143.45/MWh while wholesale prices ticked slightly up to $142.71. Substantial subsidies targeting the retail segment of the market have kept those prices particularly low. With the commissioning of the Punta Catalina coal-fired power plant in 2019, the government foresees the possibility of cutting back on subsidies without prices having to spike."}]}
