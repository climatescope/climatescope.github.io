remain wary of future policy stalemates, while Eskom is in a weak financial position and has yet to demonstrate its support for renewables. Eskom's financial woes continue amid weak power demand, non-payment by municipalities and governance issues - although a roadmap for unbundling the utility published in 2019 aims to resolve these challenges. Even though the 2019 Integrated Resource Plan bodes well for renewables, there are vocal opponents to so-called ‘expensive’ technologies. Tariffs in forthcoming renewables auction rounds could increase, as the government imposes tougher local content requirements and there is reduced space on the grid with good resource potential."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in South Africa has risen and fallen in line with the rounds of its auction program. Periods of particularly high investment have occurred in years when winning projects reached financial close. In total, renewable energy projects attracted $19.5 billion between 2004 and 2019. The years 2014-2017 averaged just $1.4 billion each, as the auction scheme was on standby, while 2018 saw more than $3.7 billion invested after the government finally signed PPAs for rounds 3.5 to 4 of the REIPPP scheme. This boost has since subsided, with just $0.7 billion invested in 2019. More than two-thirds of the 2004-2019 total was spent on solar projects, although the share compared to wind is somewhat skewed by capex-heavy solar thermal project investment. South Africa has the most diverse mix of investor types in a region typically reliant upon concessional finance for renewables projects. Of the $19.5 billion of asset finance since 2004, some 45% has come from commercial banks and another 8% from private equity."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Once the benchmark of success, South Africa's renewables auction program has been at a standstill for five years. Some 6.4GW of renewables capacity across 102 projects won support through the scheme, but no new rounds have been announced. In April 2018, the Energy Minister at the time, Jeff Radebe, signed power-purchase agreements for the 27 outstanding renewable energy projects from rounds 3.5 to 4, after three years of delays. The 2019-updated Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) outlines the country’s planned generating capacity, and includes ambitious capacity allocations of more than 20GW of wind and solar by 2030. In March 2020, a Nersa consultation opened to begin the procurement of 2GW of emergency capacity in late 2020, as well as 6.8GW of new wind and solar between 2022 and 2024, 1.5GW of new coal between 2023 and 2027, and 3GW of new gas between 2024 and 2027."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity consumption in South Africa has stagnated in recent years, declining on average 0.5% per year since 2006. The reduction has been mostly caused by heavy power users, due to factors such as economic slowdown, volatility in commodity markets and rising electricity costs. This trend has been reflected in peak demand, which fell for a second consecutive year in 2019. The main opportunity for off- or mini-grid projects in South Africa is in rural areas where electrification was at 66% in 2018, compared to 93% in urban areas. The Integrated National Electrification Plan includes initiatives to boost electricity access in rural areas – aiming to fund an estimated 723,000 grid and 49,650 non-grid connections to households by 2019/20."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Eskom, the state-owned utility, dominates South Africa’s power sector. Independent generators have started to capture generation market share, mostly renewables, and municipalities are responsible for retail of electricity in some areas - although the customer still has no choice of supplier. The country regularly exports electricity to its neighbors through the Southern African Power Pool. However, meeting peak demand is a major challenge as the supply crisis worsens. South Africa has seen regular short-term load shedding (scheduled power cuts) return over 2019 and 2020 at rates worse than the previous height of load shedding in 2014-2015. Coal dominates South Africa's electricity mix, accounting for 73% of capacity in 2018. This share is likely to be maintained once the Medupi and Kusile coal plants (at 4.8GW each) come online with the government's IPP program."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"As is common in the region, South Africa has no wholesale electricity market and the energy regulator (Nersa) determines final retail prices. Eskom has repeatedly argued for substantial tariff increases to pay back its billions of expenses. Overall, tariffs increased by an average of 13.7% a year between 2004 and 2018. Costs for renewables have also fallen. The winning tariffs dropped significantly in each renewables auction round: wind and PV fell 24% and 29% between rounds 3 and 4, after adjusting the tariffs for factors such as inflation and merchant tail. Overall, the LCOE for onshore wind in South Africa – at $62-89/MWh – falls in the middle of BNEF’s benchmark estimates in 1H 2020, as its relatively low capex is counteracted by higher financing costs. It is a similar story for PV (without tracking), which has an LCOE of $60-66/MWh."}]}
