lack of transparency and concerns of possible fraudulent behaviors surrounding the first solar project tender led to skepticism in the market. Investors lack full confidence in contract enforcement and access to land for renewable project development. Curtailment risk is relatively low and power purchase agreements are of sufficient duration, but bureaucratic hurdles are high. OSHEE, the distribution system operator and supplier of electricity for regulated tariff customers, will act as the offtaker for new renewable projects. It is undergoing a reform, using a loan from the World Bank, to reduce its debt burden. At fault are low tariffs, electricity theft, and technical losses in the distribution system. OSHEE's perilous financial position means there is higher offtaker risk and power purchase agreements will need some form of guarantee by the government or development finance organization."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Albaniaâ€™s renewable energy auctions began in 2018, but scaling and growing these has been slow. In 2020, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development helped support and prepare a tender for a solar energy project, which received a competitive price. The winning bidder was French company Voltalia. Albaniaâ€™s first solar auction, which was conducted in 2018, was also awarded to a foreign investor, but contention surrounds this transaction and it has not yet led to construction. Small hydro tends to draw largely domestic investors, while large hydro draws foreign ones."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Albania has set a target to meet 38% of its energy needs with renewable sources by 2020. The majority of its installed capacity is in the form of hydropower, though small amounts of solar PV have been breaking into the market. The National Renewable Energy Action Plan established in Albania emphasizes the need to diversify renewable energy toward solar and wind. In 2019, the country unveiled its net metering policy, which is available to systems with capacities up to 500kW. The foundation for this had been established in the Renewable Energy Law in 2017."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"All Albanians have access to electricity, and the policy focus is on ensuring the ability to meet demand in the future should it rise as hydrologic supply remains static. Albania is seeking admission to the European Union, which has provided an impetus to expand its renewable energy portfolio, both in amount and in diversity from hydropower. The World Bank is supporting a 'Dam Safety Project' for hydropower facilities that aims to improve performance in addition to safety. In 2019, German development bank KfW set forth to finance digitalizing and modernizing the power distribution network. The country also plans to expand its natural gas network."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In an 2020 update to the Law for the Electricity Sector, the Albanian government indicated that the establishment of a wholesale market is critical. However, this process has yet to be completed. Similarly, the liberalized power market has been delayed; certain customers are eligible to choose suppliers and sign bilateral contacts, while others are supplied by the distribution system operator OSHEE. With so much of its electricity supplied by hydro, the Albanian market has an outsized dependence on imports. To date no concrete steps toward establishing energy storage assets have been taken. Unbundling the market has been a long process, which has more recently been named a top priority."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Changes to political regimes in the past have led to frequent changes in tariffs and law, causing price uncertainty. Feed-in premiums/contracts for difference are granted via auctions for renewable energy sources with more than 2MW capacity. Electricity prices in Albania are lower than those in the European Union. ERE, the Albanian energy regulator, sets the tariffs for energy each year. For certain sized projects, these tariffs apply. For larger projects, there is no guaranteed offtake and the terms can be negotiated."}]}
