scarcity and long drawn land acquisition processes are major barriers to investment in renewables in the country. Non-dispatchable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar have a negligible amount of grid connected capacity, thus, risks associated with grid balancing issues are low currently. If any curtailments do happen, then private independent power producers will be the first ones to face them. Bangladesh's supply chain for renewables is not well developed and is highly dependent on imports. Government subsidies for power generated from coal and gas power plants distort market pricing and increase the price competitiveness barrier for renewable energy projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in grid-connected projects is starting to pick up in Bangladesh – money is also flowing into some renewable projects, particularly solar. No new wind plants have been installed in Bangladesh in many years and there have been no announcements of new projects either. Land constraints, high equipment costs and lack of domestic supply chain are deterrents. Almost all renewables financing is provided by domestic lenders that in turn have access to credit lines from multilateral institutions and development banks like the World Bank and International Finance Corporation. IDCOL is the biggest recipient and disburser of renewable financing."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Bangladesh has a target of raising the share of renewables in total electricity production to 10% by 2021 from the current 2%. At present, the country has 649MW of installed renewable energy capacity out of a total 20GW. Current developments are slow and the target is unlikely to be met. Land scarcity, delays in getting project approvals and high equipment costs are deterring a faster growth. While some renewable projects have secured reasonable feed-in tariffs, they face the risk of cancellations due to delays in getting project approvals. Large-scale auctions are rare. Net metering is offered for rooftop PV, with limits on plant size. The government-owned financing institution, the Infrastructure Development Company (IDCOL), introduced the Solar Home System (SHS) program in 2003 for providing subsidized systems to remote parts of the country.  It is one of the largest off-grid solar programs in the world and as of January 2019, covered 12% of the country’s total population."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Bangladesh is a power-starved nation and demand will only go up as the country grows in population and GDP. Load shedding is prevalent, particularly in rural areas. The government adopted a Vision 2021 plan which aims at electricity for all by 2021. The country has two types of rural electrification programs: extension of the conventional grid to remote areas and installation of solar irrigation pumps, solar mini grids and improved cook stoves. Apart from these, IDCOL started a solar home system program in 2003 to supply electricity to areas where grid expansion is challenging. Increases in the country’s power requirements will be met through a combination of new power generation projects and electricity imports from India."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"As much as 76% of electricity generated in Bangladesh comes from natural gas power plants. However, the country’s gas supplies are dwindling and reliance on imported fuel - chiefly LNG and coal - is set to rise. Coal power plants are under development with tie-ups from countries like China and India. Bangladesh is also building a 2GW nuclear plant with support from Russia. While private independent power producers or IPPs are involved in power generation, a large proportion of that share is short-term emergency rental plants. Transmission and retail businesses are dominated by government companies. Bangladesh Power Development Board acts as a single wholesale-buyer of all electricity. Third-party power purchases are not permitted unless it is a captive plant. Renewables, including large hydro, produce only 2% of electricity. This share may hold steady as rooftop solar projects increase in the coming years."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Average power prices in Bangladesh are lower than its neighbor India, even though Bangladesh generates most of its electricity from more expensive natural gas compared to cheap domestic coal in India. To keep the retail tariffs low, the government provides subsidies at two levels – by selling fuel to power generation companies at below the market rate and by providing subsidies to the power distribution companies. The rate of increase in retail tariffs is low and these are not revised at regular intervals. For instance, the latest tariff revision was done in February 2020, more than two years after the last revision. Cross-subsidies are prevalent. While residential customers are not required to pay a time-of-day charge, industrial and commercial consumers have a time-based tariff mechanism."}]}
