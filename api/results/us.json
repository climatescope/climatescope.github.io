to renewable energy development vary by region in the U.S. In markets like PJM there are unambitious renewable portfolio standards, relatively weak renewable resources, plenty of cheap natural gas and enduring market oversupply. Therefore, in PJM, there will continue to be plenty of gas build in the near future with relatively little renewable build. In other markets, where renewables are more competitive economically, the high levels of inflexible generation have already led to intermittency issues, reflected in blackouts in California and extreme price spikes in Ercot. Also in some markets, renewable penetration is high enough that power price suppression in renewable generation hours leads to systems cannibalizing their own returns."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The U.S. is the second-largest investor in clean energy in the world, setting a new record at $55.5 billion of investment in 2019. Renewable energy generation accounted for 18% of the total U.S. power mix in 2019, up from 10% in 2010, and has accounted for 56% of all capacity expansion in the last decade. This increase is driven largely by wind and solar investment and expansion, particularly in Texas and California; wind and solar build has hit around 20GW annually for the past few years and the combined generation of these two technologies rose by 13% in 2019 alone. Through the ITC and PTC, the rapid development of renewable technologies across the board cost the federal treasury around $8.7 billion in 2019. One driver of investment in the U.S. in particular is the corporate procurement of clean energy, a rising trend in which corporations purchase clean energy through power purchase agreements (PPAs), largely in Texas. In 2019, 13.6GW of corporate PPAs were signed, with Google signing 1.7GW alone."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The United States clean energy policy is driven by state-level initiatives, mainly renewable portfolio standards (or RPSs), which mandate the percentage of sales a load serving entity needs to meet with qualified, renewable facilities in a given state. In 2019, 29 states and DC had RPS mandates and multiple states had accompanying voluntary targets. States with the most aggressive mandated and voluntary renewable energy ambitions include California, which is aiming for 100% zero-carbon energy by 2045, and New York, aiming for the same by 2040. The other state-led initiative is the development and participation in carbon markets. The U.S. has two cap-and-trade programs, an economywide program in California and the power-sector-only Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the Northeast. On a federal level, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has announced intentions to re-enter the Paris Agreement, which commits the nation to reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The president-elect has also discussed ambitions to make U.S. electricity production carbon-free by 2035. Outside of these overarching goals, the United States maintains federal tax credit programs (the ITC and PTC), which allow investors in qualified renewable facilities to claim a certain percentage of those facilities’ capital expenditures against their tax liability."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"For the past 15 years, electricity demand in the U.S. has been relatively flat. However, over that same period, gas-fired and renewable energy have continually displaced increasingly uneconomic coal and nuclear plants. Both these trends are likely to continue in the short term as natural gas remains cheap, renewable power plant capital costs fall, and states and corporations continue to ramp up mandated and voluntary procurement targets. Increased renewable penetration will also lead to more opportunities for energy storage, as greater flexible capacity will be needed."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The U.S. power markets consist of 11 primary regions, the three largest of which from a generation standpoint are PJM, MISO and the Southeast. Other frequently discussed regions are California and Ercot (Texas). Broadly, regions in the U.S. are either regulated (where vertically integrated utilities control the generation, transmission and distribution of energy) or deregulated (where utility ownership of power plants is less common and IPPs own a greater share of generating assets). Across all regions, the asset owners with the largest portfolios are Duke Energy, Southern Co. and NextEra. Within these regions, there are individual markets that maintain individual wholesale power pricing mechanisms; power exporting/importing occurs between and within markets."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Across the U.S., annual wholesale power prices spanned $20/MWh-$40/MWh in 2019, with the most expensive power in markets with particularly tight supply-demand dynamics: the Northwest (which relies on hydropower) and Texas (which is a high-renewables, energy-only market). These 2019 prices generally dropped from those in 2018 as natural gas prices fell and renewable generation ramped up. Retail prices also vary across markets with New York, New England and California maintaining retail rates upward of $160/MWh and all other regions spanning $80-110/MWh. Total energy spending accounted for under 4% of total U.S. personal consumption expenditures in 2019. The share of consumer spending that goes to energy continues to decrease with the rise of renewables and energy efficiency measures. Residential small-scale solar growth has been stagnant in the U.S. for the past few years with 11 notable market exits and bankruptcies since 2016. California remains the largest residential solar market in the U.S. As of the end of 2019, net metering at the full retail rate was available in 38 states and Washington, D.C."}]}
