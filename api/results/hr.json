2020, the main bottleneck to clean energy investment in Croatia in the short to medium term was that the country was well ahead of its 2020 targets for the sector, whilst electricity supply and demand were broadly in balance after the recent economic slowdown. This is now set to change as Croatia has raised its decarbonization targets for 2030. Croatia continues to suffer from slow administrative procedures for clean energy projects despite improvements in recent years."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Croatia witnessed a small investment boom between 2010, the year after the new energy strategy was ratified, and 2014 when the regulator decided to cap the availability of feed-in tariffs. The wind sector attracted $842 million of the $1.015 billion in clean energy investment since 2010. This is to be credited to the more generous incentive for utility-scale onshore wind assets than for solar projects. BloombergNEF expects a boost in Croatia’s renewables investments as auctions for feed-in premiums and guaranteed purchase price take off."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Croatia set renewable energy targets for 2030 in its final Integrated National Energy and Climate plan for 2021-2030. The country aims to expand the share of renewables in final energy consumption to 36.4% by 2030: 63.8% in electricity, 36.6% in heat and cooling, and 13.2% in transport. The energy strategy legislation includes feed-in premiums and guaranteed power purchase prices for wind and solar, awarded via auctions. So far, no support was awarded under the scheme. However, the Croatian Market Operator for Energy (HROTE) launched the first auction for feed-in premium and guaranteed purchase price in August 2020."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Croatia’s electricity consumption had dropped in recent years from an all-time high of 18.61TWh in 2009 to 16.97TWh in 2017, but has recovered in 2018. This drop has taken place against a backdrop of economic slowdown that has seen Croatia’s GDP drop from $70.5 billion in 2008 to $50.4 billion in 2016. The main investment opportunities in the power sector arise from renewables buildouts and revitalization of existing power stations (especially hydropower plants), which should ensure that Croatia meets its 2030 decarbonization targets. In July 2018, HEP secured 140 million euros from the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to build a 150MW gas-based combined heat and power plant. The plant will supply the city of Zagreb and replace existing highly polluting heat-only oil and gas plants."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"An aging hydro (45-55%) and fossil-fuel (40%) generation fleet supplies the bulk of Croatia’s domestically produced electricity. Croatia relies on imports from neighboring countries to meet its electricity consumption. In 2018, Croatia covered some 34% of its electricity consumption with imports. The power market has gone through an unbundling reform to bring it in line with the EU’s energy packages. The generation and retail markets are fully liberalized. The transmission system operator, whilst still being owned by the national utility, has been spun out as independent entity, similar to the set-up in France."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Most of the electricity in Croatia still trades bilaterally between the state-owned utilities that dominate the generation and retail segments of the market. This has resulted in extremely low traded volumes in the wholesale power market, giving little value to the 50-100 euros/MWh prices that have come out of it. In terms of renewables cost, the $1.55 million/MW capex for onshore wind projects recorded in 2017 falls well within our $133-197 LCOE range for Europe."}]}
