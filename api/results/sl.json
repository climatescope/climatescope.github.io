Energy Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA) is the only organization authorized to buy power in grid-connected areas. It buys the electricity from the Independent Power Producers and collects revenue from grid customers, but since electricity is subsidized, EDSA has financing problems. Generation curtailment happens regularly due to the poor grid conditions. Finally, political risk is also important for mini-grid developers, since the Government prioritizes grid extensions over mini-grids or off-grid. Mini-grids built in an area where the grid will expand will be merged into the main grid."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Grid-connected clean energy investments in Sierra Leone have only increased with the construction of several mini hydro power plants in different small distribution grids, as well as the 34 MW biomass power plant, commissioned in 2012. There are some renewable projects in the pipeline, including 6MW of PV in Freetown, currently under construction, and 143MW Bumbuna II hydro, construction of which is beginning in 2021. Financing organizations of clean-energy investments, both on-grid and off-grid, have so far been development agencies, governments or clean-energy-driven investment funds."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Sierra Leone approved its first and only clean energy policy in March 2017, setting a target for 79.7% and 84% of final energy to come from renewables by 2020 and 2030, respectively. Little progress has been made on thse targets, since the country depends on external funding to reach them. The government’s Action Plan from 2014-2017 aimed to increase renewables while raising total capacity from 75MW to 1,000MW, however, no progress has been made as the state of the main grid has prevented new generation assets from being connected. Besides, the only incentive for renewable energy to grow is a reduction in import taxes on solar products, but this is rarely enforced in customs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"According to the 2018 Integrated Household Survey, grid electricity customers in Sierra Leone received around 15 hours of electricity a week. Several sites for large hydro have been identified and announced, however, the grid needs improving to ensure efficient power transmission as well as to connect additional capacity. On the other hand, there is potential for mini-grids and off-grid solar in rural areas. Today, there are 60 operating mini-grids that are part of a project funded by the U.K.’s DFID that identified 94 sites for development and within which customers can buy electricity tokens using pay-as-you-go services. Off-grid solar is also financed with pay-as-you-go, although mobile has limited penetration."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In Sierra Leone’s power market, only generation is open to private participation. Grid-connected independent power producers, or IPPs, must sell their electricity to EDSA, the state-owned main utility. However, the regulatory commission can provide retail licenses to other suppliers in areas where the grid is not available. Sierra Leone’s grid system is composed of several isolated distribution grids, of which Bumbuna-Freetown and Bo-Kenema are the main ones. Grid-connected generation capacity is around 30% hydro and 70% oil-fired power plants, plus one 15MW biomass plant. There are some hydro and other renewables projects in the pipeline, as well as oil projects. However, the current grid status is preventing the allocation of additional capacity."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Sierra Leone’s grid customers are from the residential, small commercial or public sector. Electricity prices are regulated by the Water and Electricity Regulatory Commission, and they have risen. As of 2019, the residential grid-connected electricity price was 1,600 SLL/kWh, or 0.21 USD/kWh, which is far from being cost-reflective. Until 2018, and starting in 2016, the price was set at 1,475 SLL/kWh, or 0.20 USD/kWh. Finally, Sierra Leone subsidizes the first 25 kWh of residential electricity consumed in a month with a regulated price of 560 SLL/kWh, or 0.06USD/kWh, compared with its subsidy of the first 50 kWh in 2016. Based on the 2018 Integrated Household Survey, it is estimated that urban-area grid consumption was around 40 kWh/month per household. Off-grid electricity tariffs are also regulated, but cost-reflective and non-subsidized, at around 0.6 USD/kWh."}]}
