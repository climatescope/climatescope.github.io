barriers to the government's offshore wind program include a lack of available sites in the North Sea, which is increasingly space-constrained and shared by multiple uses and stakeholders. Offshore power could create an over-capacity issue for the high-voltage grid on land, leading congestion to be a bigger problem as witnessed in such markets as Germany. Furthermore, the country’s high population density and substantial volumes of installed onshore wind capacity could lead to opposition against new wind farms, which could incite high levels of litigation as seen in France and Germany."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Together, onshore and offshore wind projects attracted the biggest share of clean energy investment between 2004 and 2019, at 47% of total investment or $18.4 billion. Solar investment has avoided the ups and downs that have characterized the PV sector in other European markets. Annual investment in the sector has remained between $0.9 billion and 3 billion since 2015. Most financing has come from commercial banks, with Rabobank topping the list for loans to renewable energy projects by a significant margin. The European Investment Bank, the EU’s lending arm, has also been active in providing investments to the clean energy sector, and has come in second place."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The Netherlands is falling behind on its EU target to source 14% of final energy consumption from renewables by 2020, having achieved just 7% in 2018. Its Climate Plan of June 2019 introduced a strategy to further decarbonize the economy in areas such as buildings, transport, industry and agriculture. A 2029 coal phase-out has been set, although the pace of closures has been accelerated by a landmark climate ruling – the Urgenda case – which has already moved forward the closure of a 630MW unit. This will bring emissions closer to the country's 2020 targets. The government has ramped up auction budgets in recent years with the aim of accelerating deployment. It also has one of the most ambitious offshore wind programs in the world. A roadmap for the technology published in March 2018 outlines plans to build a further 7GW between 2024 and 2030. A major turning point for the gas-reliant country came with the decision to halt extraction from the Groningen gas field by 2030 following renewed tremors in January 2018. This will fuel a more general transition away from gas-fired generation and heating in coming years. A ban on connecting new homes to the gas grid, passed in June 2018, is a step in this direction."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity demand declined by 11% in the 10 years ending 2017 and tumbled further in 2020 due to lockdown measures. It is not expected to ramp up significantly in the next few decades, despite a slight uptick due to increased electric vehicle usage. The Netherlands will maintain its ambition with regards renewable energy over forthcoming decades. This includes a target to ramp up renewables generation by almost 400% between 2018 and 2030, while the SDE+ program is set to be replaced from 2020 by the SDE++. The new scheme will aim to deliver 985 million euros in funding to sectors including renewable power, biofuels and clean heating by 2030. The Netherlands is also a leading market in Europe for corporate PPAs, benefiting from good resources, stable renewables incentives, national green energy commitments, and domestically located companies with high demand for electricity and sustainability objectives. BNEF has tracked some 642MW in corporate PPAs between 2014 and 2019 in the Netherlands for renewable energy projects."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"With an emission intensity rating of 482.5MtCO2e/MWh in 2017, the domestic power fleet is Western Europe’s most polluting. The Dutch capacity mix remains dominated by fossil fuels, with gas accounting for 56.8% and coal 14.3% in 2017. This breakdown is due to change over forthcoming decades as the Netherlands implements its 2030 coal phase-out and moves away from burning gas. The country's ambitious auction program will ramp up the offshore wind capacity. The question will be how the government compensates coal plant owners (Nuon Vattenfall, Uniper, RWE and Engie) given that three of the power stations came online in 2015. Forthcoming compensation payments to Nuon for the accelerated closure of one of its coal plants as a result of the Urgenda case could set a precedent. Wholesale power prices in the Netherlands are close to the EU average, and have also declined gradually in recent years as more no-marginal-cost renewables have entered the generation mix. More broadly, the Netherlands' electricity market has been fully open to competition since 2004, but generation remains dominated by a handful of companies."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Dutch offshore wind tenders have attracted headlines for record-low or even zero-subsidy bids. However, this trend should not be seen as the new norm for project costs in Europe, as the sites in the Netherlands have been closer to shore, and in shallower waters, than many others under development in the North Sea. In addition, the development and transmission costs are being covered by the Dutch government. The project owners are expected to hedge a significant part of future revenue via a corporate or utility PPA, or other financial instruments. Nonetheless, offshore wind projects in the Netherlands enjoy some of the lowest levelized costs of electricity in Europe. BNEF’s estimates show that costs are continuing to drop, having reduced from $71-87/MWh in 1H 2018 to $55-74/MWh in 1H 2020."}]}
