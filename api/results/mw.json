almost complete reliance on hydropower from the Shire River is a concentrated risk. If water levels remain low, the country will need a new fleet of generation assets to supply power. The local currency has experienced high inflation, which is a concern for foreign investors. There are no local manufacturers of equipment for solar, wind, or hydro, so everything is imported. To encourage renewable development, import tariffs have been removed for all renewable equipment. However, the quality of imports, especially for solar equipment, is often low or even non-functional. This has led to frustration and distrust among potential adopters of solar. Additionally, electricity theft is an issue and will weigh on developers' financial considerations."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"While the government supports investment in clean energy, it has not made any investments itself. Almost all investment is foreign, and renewable developers operating in the country are all foreign subsidiaries as well. International development banks are a popular source of capital for renewable projects. Overall investment doesn't seem to be growing, which could be due to high inflation and volatile exchange rates shaking investor confidence. Malawi seems willing to experiment technology-wise, as PPAs have been signed for solar, wind and small hydro. Solar is the most commonly funded technology, and a 20MW PPA was recently signed for the country's first floating solar plant, financed by a German developer."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Historically, 90% of Malawi’s primary energy has come from burning biomass and only 3% has been met by electricity. Trees are cut down to make charcoal, leading to national concerns of deforestation and exacerbated impacts from climate change. In 2003, the government announced a goal of meeting 7% of primary energy demand with renewable generation by 2020. This was not an ambitious goal, especially given the time allotted. Thanks to Malawi’s buildout of hydropower dams, the country now produces about 70% of its power from renewable sources. In 2016, the generation market opened up to participation from IPPs. Since then, the central regulator has signed PPAs for roughly 200 MW of renewable energy. This year, the country reached financial close on a 70MW solar project, the first of its kind. The project is delayed due to Covid-19. ESCOM, the central utility, has consistently issued tenders and awarded PPAs, though no projects have been completed to date."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Malawi is one of the least electrified countries globally, with an overall electrification rate of roughly 10%. In rural areas, this reduces to 1%, although many live within 10 km of electrical infrastructure. The country's rural electrification fund has an aim of extending the existing grid, not building off-grid, but has not been able to increase electrification significantly according to reported results. Resource potential for solar and mini grid solutions is high. Though Escom, the central utility, has no plans to build solar assets of its own, it has awarded solar PPAs to a number of foreign developers."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Essentially 100% of Malawi's electricity generation comes from hydropower plants situated on the Shire River. In recent years, low water levels and debris in the river have significantly reduced electricity output and caused severe load shedding. Malawi has no significant interconnection to neighboring countries. In 2016, the generation market was opened to participation by IPPs. Since then, PPAs have been signed for some 200 MW of new renewable generation. However, nothing has been built yet. With no IPP assets yet operational, Malawi's central utility ESCOM owns all generation, transmission, and distribution assets. MERA, the central regulatory agency, is the single offtaker."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power tariffs have steadily increased in recent years in order for the central utility to raise revenue and improve the energy deficit. For customers, price increases are highly upsetting in the midst of severe load shedding. Fuel prices are increasing significantly, which is bad news because the country increasingly relies on diesel generation for emergency power. Malawi does not have any significant interconnection to neighboring markets so is unable to import power. German financial aid has been secured to build a 400kV substation and 218 km power line between Mozambique and Malawi, which would improve power supply in the country and potentially bring down its price."}]}
