content requirements are the primary hurdle to the deployment of clean energy. Other hindrances are rules limited foreign ownership of joint ventures to 49% and the governmentâ€™s reluctance to issue sovereign payment guarantees, a concern in light of the possibility of Sonelgaz being restructured. While 2020 saw a loosening of limited foreign ownership rules in other sectors in order to attract more foreign investment, they still apply to energy and electricity. Amid its ongoing political strife, Algeria is seen as a risky market."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Most renewables capacity in Algeria consists of small-scale PV installations of around 15-20MW. Clean energy investments seem to have  petered out. While the domestic clean energy industry attracted investments totaling $668 million between 2006 and 2014, only two small deals were made in subsequent years, with the country recording no new deals since 2017. Finance has been lackluster for a number of reasons, including a national focus on developing new gas plants while modernizing the existing power fleet. Actors bidding into auctions must do so with a local partner and finance must be domestically sourced â€“ a challenge as Algerian banks remain reluctant to back clean energy undertakings, despite their involvement in a handful projects over past years."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Until recently, Algeria had an ambitious renewables target in place to add 22GW of renewables capacity by 2030. This was scaled back in February 2020, with the new target aiming for 16GW of renewables by 2035, with a mid-term goal of 4GW by 2024. This change underlines Algeria's renewed focus on building out its gas capacity. After limited success, the countryâ€™s feed-in tariff was replaced by tenders in 2018. These have been fraught with delays and cancellations, with the lack of progress in large part due to stringent local content rules, restrictions on the involvement of foreign actors and uncertainties about access to finance. While a 150MW solar tender held in early 2019 was undersubscribed, a subsequent 50MW PV tender was successful."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"An administratively burdensome bureaucracy and high taxes do little to attract investment. Sonelgaz is the offtaker for utility-scale projects. However, the utilityâ€™s financials have been strained over recent years as it suffers from low commodity prices, widespread fraud and structural inefficiencies. In addition to the company running up debts, many of Sonelgazâ€™s customers are behind on payments. The group launched legal proceedings against over 50 companies it claims owe it money in August 2019. Despite the possibility of arrears on payments, the risk of the offtaker defaulting is held in check by Sonelgaz being backed by the government and domestic banks."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Algeria opened up generation to competition in 2002, but the sector has remained dominated by Sonelgaz. The state-owned utilityâ€™s dominance is ensured by its access to the countryâ€™s abundant gas reserves, whose cheap procurement has prevented the emergence of competitive independent power producers (IPP). The Sonelgaz group is the sole authorized retailer of power on the countryâ€™s three grids. However, consumers are free to procure their own electricity through self-generation or power purchase agreements (PPA). Increasingly cheap solar technology, the high cost of diesel generation and unreliable grid power have created a favorable environment for small-scale renewables."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Prices for clean energy are driven up by the requirement to use locally manufactured equipment. While the domestic solar manufacturing industry has started producing panels at scale, product costs remain far higher than those sold internationally. Retail electricity rates are relatively low by virtue of the countryâ€™s rich gas resources. Those rates have not been raised in recent years as low oil and gas prices have strained the public purse since they began to fall in 2014. The current political uncertainty renders reforms in this area unlikely."}]}
