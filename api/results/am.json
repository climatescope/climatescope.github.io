barriers to investment exist in Armenia. There is domestic and international funding available to support projects and also tax incentives. The process to build and connect renewable energy is relatively straightforward and the domestic supply chain for PV services and equipment is gradually building. Smaller projects from 500kW to 5MW can receive licenses and a set tariff for at least 15 years. Although activity slowed when the new government came into power in 2018, steps are being taken to advance announced tenders and to update the regulatory framework for small-scale PV."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in utility-scale PV is on the rise thanks to several auctions. Spain’s Fotowatio Renewable Ventures BV won Armenia’s first auction to develop the 55MW Masrik-1 PV plant in 2018, backed by the ‘Scaling up Renewable Energy Program’ (SREP) and the World Bank. A further 55MW government-led tender is likely to be opened at the end of the year to support five smaller projects. The Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (Anif), a non-governmental entity, is also running a tender for 200MW PV. Wind development has stalled following a decrease of the wind feed-in tariff from $0.09/kWh to $0.05/kWh in 2019. Since 2016, the Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund has provided concession financing for small-scale clean energy and energy efficiency programs."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Armenia is unlikely to reach an ambitious 21% renewable generation by 2020, which excludes large hydro, given the current share is 13%, but the country may approach 26% by 2025 with the growing uptake of utility-scale PV. Since 2007, Armenia has encouraged clean energy development with 15- to 20-year technology-specific feed-in tariffs. However, these tariffs are quite low, especially for wind where the tariff halved in 2019, therefore stalling discussions with developers. Renewable energy equipment is exempt from customs duties and the value-added-tax may be adjourned for up to three years following an official request. Residential and commercial customers can consume their own generation and sell it to the grid at 50% of residential prices for PV (or 100% for small hydro). This was limited to 150kW and then increased to 500kW in 2019. The uptake of self-generation has been high, totaling over 50MW PV and 374MW small hydro."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Armenia is 100% electrified. Although it imports gas and nuclear fuel, it is a net exporter of electricity. Peak operational demand has been decreasing slightly as more energy efficiency and behind-the-meter projects are installed. A focus on energy efficiency, particularly in buildings, could further decrease electricity demand. Slashed wind tariffs have dissuaded wind project development for now. There are plans to extend the life of hydro plants, and while the government is considering refurbishing the remaining nuclear plant, this would be extremely expensive."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Gas plants provide 40% of generation, nuclear 28% and large hydro 19%. Small hydro, solar and wind make up the remaining 13%. The country’s aging nuclear plant will eventually need an expensive life extension or replacement. Armenia aims to reduce its heavy reliance on gas imports and increase its diversity of resources. Aside from large hydro, renewables play a small but growing role. The power market is still fully regulated, although reforms are underway to shift to a deregulated wholesale market. The generation market is fully liberalized with a range of local and international owners. Transmission is controlled by the state-owned High Voltage Electric Network (HVEN). For now, only Electric Networks Armenia (ENA) is the only buyer and supplier of power for residential and industrial customers."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices are fully regulated, although deregulation toward a wholesale market has begun. Residential tariffs are higher than commercial and industrial prices. Compared to neighboring Georgia, residential prices are much more expensive, although commercial and industrial prices are similar. Energy security is a major driver for the shift toward renewable energy, as Armenia imports all gas and nuclear fuel for its generation. The cost of clean energy is falling compared to new gas. The Masrik-1 solar auction price of $41.90/MWh was lower than governments expected, and it is likely to be used as a baseline tariff for future auctions."}]}
