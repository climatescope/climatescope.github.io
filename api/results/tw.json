do not allow Taiwanese companies to import solar cells and wind turbines from mainland China, slowing down the decrease in project capex and levelized costs made possible by the mainland market’s massive scale. Local so-called Nimby (Not-in-my-backyard) movements, taking the form of environmental protectionism, and land transfer challenges, are significant barriers to project implementation. Taipower has modified the feed-in tariff rules at least twice before: in 2010 to shorten the commissioning deadline for solar auction winners, and then in 2012-13, to renegotiate tariffs with thermal independent power producers. The Ministry of Economic Affairs also cut the 2019 offshore wind FiT, lowering the revenue for developers who secured projects in 2018, yet failed to sign power purchase agreements with Taipower before year-end. These changes increase the risks of investing in renewables in Taiwan."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Solar has so far attracted most of the clean energy investment in Taiwan though investment in wind is poised to grow significantly, largely because the government auctioned 5.5GW of offshore capacity in 2018. Taiwan’s local banks have lent to solar projects, and are becoming comfortable with offshore wind assets. BloombergNEF estimates that offshore wind investment totaled $7.8 billion in Taiwan in 2019, which pushed clean energy investment in the island market to a historical high and made it the second biggest market for offshore wind investment in the world that year, after mainland China."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Taiwan’s feed-in tariffs helped expand wind and solar capacity to 5GW by the end of 2019. The new administration, which came to power in 2016, launched an aggressive energy transition plan to phase out nuclear by 2025 while adding 25GW of renewables. Though most of Taiwan’s residents were in favor of extending the life of nuclear power in a referendum at the end of 2018, the administration is keeping to its promise of phasing out nuclear by 2025. Lucrative feed-in tariffs (FiT) for offshore wind have attracted major European developers and financiers from Taiwan and overseas. Solar installations exceeded 1GW in 2018 on the back of strong rooftop solar promotion programs, though long-term challenges in land acquisition for utility-scale projects remain."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Taiwan’s power demand is only expected to grow modestly at 1.6% in the next two decades, according to Taiwan Research Institute. Yet the government’s intention to take all the 5.1GW nuclear power capacity offline by 2025 creates opportunities for renewable energy. The island has been receptive to foreign players, granting three-quarters of the 3.8GW offshore wind capacity announced in April 2018 to overseas developers. The government is also working with global supply chain companies to establish a local offshore wind manufacturing hub. Overseas banks have also participated in project financing."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal accounted for 47% of Taiwan’s power generation in 2019. This position is likely to change with the government’s energy transition set to increase the share of gas power to 50% and renewables to 20% of total generation by 2025, while phasing out nuclear power, which accounted for 12% of generation in 2019. To spur accelerated growth, policies have been introduced to give renewable energy priority dispatch and permission to be sold directly to end-users on the unregulated market.

In 2018, the residential tariff was the third lowest and the industrial tariff the fifth lowest according to Taipower, the vertically integrated utility that owns 64% of Taiwan’s total power capacity, and the International Energy Agency. The utility raised the average retail tariff by 3% in April 2018 for the first time in four years. Industry and large commercial companies will feel the brunt of the increase, while 80% of residents and small businesses are not affected. Adding new and potentially more expensive renewables and gas generation will further stress Taipower's balance sheet as the cost cannot be fully passed on to end-consumers: retail power rate hikes are capped at 3% every six months by law."}]}
