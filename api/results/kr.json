from local communities is one of the biggest barriers to developing power generation projects in Korea. Local communities including residents, farmers, fisheries and environmental groups often oppose power plant development, which may cause severe delays in permitting and even cancellation of projects. To address this, the government is making efforts to streamline the permitting processes and provide clearer compensation guidelines for local communities, but these measures are unlikely to fully resolve the complex challenges around local community engagement."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Korea’s clean energy sector attracted some $2.4 billion of investment in 2019 with the majority flowing into utility-scale solar and wind projects. Annual investment has been relatively stagnant since 2016 as falling capex of renewable energy projects mostly offset the annual growth in capacity additions. Korea's 2030 renewables target aims for an injection of some $101 billion into the clean energy sector. The government vowed to provide $17 billion-loan for small-scale power providers. State energy firms, including Korea Electric Power Corp., will invest $47 billion to build new facilities. The government expects the remaining $37 billion to come from the private sector."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"South Korea embarked on a ‘Green Growth’ strategy in 2010 under President Lee Myung-bak, aimed at stimulating the economy and securing energy independence in the long-run. President Moon Jae-in came to power in 2017 and sought a more fundamental shift in the country’s energy policy to ensure environmental sustainability. Through the country’s 8th Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand launched in December 2017, President Moon officially scrapped plans for a number of new nuclear and coal-fired power plants and signaled strong support for gas generation and renewable energy. In July 2020, the Moon administration announced the Korean New Deal, a $133 billion post-coronavirus spending package designed to accelerate the country’s energy transition and digitalize its social infrastructure. The plan aims to add 30GW of solar and wind capacity by 2025. Despite ongoing effort towards a cleaner power mix, electricity generation in South Korea is currently dominated by coal (40%) followed by nuclear power (26%) and gas generators (26%) with renewables contributing only 6% in 2019. The government aims to increase the share of renewables generation to 20% by 2030. Renewable portfolio standards (RPS), introduced in 2012 to replace the feed-in tariff program, are the primary driver of renewable energy deployment in Korea. The country also has an emissions trading scheme that was launched in 2015."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Korea’s electricity demand will likely rise until mid-2030s, driven by the country’s energy-intensive manufacturing sectors such as steel making, automotive and electronics. The novel coronavirus in 2020 will likely apply downward pressure on electricity demand in the near term but economic recovery, coupled with modest population growth, will likely push up demand in the long term. Demand for renewable energy will continue to rise as the government aims to achieve 20% renewable generation by 2030 from just 7% in 2020. The government also plans to launch various procurement mechanisms of renewable energy in 2021 including third party power purchase agreement or PPA, green tariff, and direct investment in renewable energy."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The wholesale power market operates on a day-ahead, cost-based pool, in which the hourly price of electricity is determined by the variable cost of the marginal power plant. While the wholesale market is open to competition, Korea Electric Power Corp. monopolizes grid operation and retail market. Renewable energy power plants receive revenue from the sale of electricity on the wholesale power market as well as through the sale of renewable energy certificates. Korea Energy Agency issues 1 REC per every 1 MWh of electricity generated from renewable sources. Large-scale utilities purchase RECs to meet their annual RPS requirement set by the government. The requirement obligates utilities to procure a set share of their total generation from renewable sources: 7% (2020), 9% (2021), 10% (2022)."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Korea has government-regulated fixed retail electricity rates. In 2019, retail customers paid an average of $9.8 U.S. cents(112 won)/kWh. On the generation side, coal remains the cheapest source of power generation with the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) ranging between $59-71/MWh in 2020. The cost of building solar and wind projects in Korea is among the highest globally with LCOEs ranging between $73-146/MWh for solar and $78-142/MWh for wind. Market price distortion from subsidy (i.e. RPS), mountainous geography, and limited project scale due to difficulties around permitting and site acquisition lead to higher cost of renewable energy in Korea."}]}
