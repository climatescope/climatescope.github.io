biggest barrier to new investment is its fragmented politics, a problem that has plagued the country for decades. Lack of confidence in the government fosters uncertainty in the entire Italian economy, which in turn drags down the energy sector. Another barrier to new developments is the lack of interest in corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs). Creditworthy buyers tend to prefer market exposure to the predictability of long-term contracts. Permitting issues remain. Developers of small projects must apply with local authorities for building permits. Larger projects go through a central authority but also must liaise with local jurisdictions. Finally, Italy is notorious for being averse to onshore and offshore wind which is seen as invading the scenery and harming tourism."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in new clean energy has struggled to recover since the government stopped subsidizing the build of utility-scale solar in 2013. At $1.8 billion, 2018 investment was the highest since 2013 but still a fraction of the 2011 high of $33 billion, when Italy connected 9.5GW of PV to the grid. A mix of wind projects with contracts from the 2016 renewables auction, and merchant solar projects drove the 2018 increase in investment. In June 2019, the European Commission gave approval to Italy’s $6 billion subsidy support package, meant to run until 2021. The government allocated the money in mixed technology auctions with a goal to buy around 5.6GW of capacity. This, combined with rising interest in unsubsidized projects, should boost clean investment numbers in the coming years. In the long term, Italy’s 2030 NECP goal of getting more than half its electricity from renewables will also provide investors with clarity. Italy also has a very active secondary market for solar, with 744MW of capacity changing hands in 2018."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Italy’s National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) aims to achieve 26% of generation from renewables in 2020 and 55% in 2030. There is no rush to build more renewable capacity as it has achieved its 2020 target. The Italian renewable industry is looking forward to a new round of subsidies, as the European Commission granted state aid approval to the country’s auction scheme in 2019. This will revive investment in renewables, which slumped in 2013 as subsidies ended. As of September 2020, two auctions awarded a total of 964MW of contracts to wind and solar generators. The country must ramp up construction for its 2030 target of 55% renewables in electricity generation."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The Italian government is looking to stimulate the wind and solar industry. It has re-introduced auctions and is looking to cut red tape around permitting. As part of an EU-wide effort, it is in the process of finalizing its 2030 renewable electricity generation target. All of these should help investors get the clarity and confidence to finance new projects. Italian demand has been growing at an average 1% per year since 2014, complementing government efforts. We expect this trend to continue at an average of 0.5% per year until 2040. Enel, the largest generator in Italy, has also been investing in digitalization. It plans to have 90% of its power generation fleet automated by 2020, with 60% enabled by internet-of-things connectivity, to boost plant performance and reduce operations and maintenance costs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Italian gas plants supplied 41% of electricity generated in 2019, followed by hydro at 18%, and wind and solar at a combined 20%. Despite gas plants making up the biggest generation share, their utilization rate in 2019 was a lowly 28%. As a result, many Italian gas plants struggle to make a profit and are at risk of closure. However, the most efficient ones run often and enjoy some of the biggest margins in Europe. The 2025 coal phase-out would reduce some of the overcapacity in the Italian market, although it is part of a non-binding energy plan. The recently approved capacity market has given marginal generators a boost. It held its first auction in 2019 and awarded 30GW of capacity contracts to existing gas generators and 5GW for new build."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Italy’s power prices are higher than the European average largely due to limited interconnection and its large natural gas fleet’s exposure to commodity prices. This issue will only intensify after the country’s 2025 mandated coal phaseout. In fact, the phaseout will make coal prices irrelevant in the country and at greatly reduce the effect of carbon prices. BloombergNEF expects the power price in neighboring countries to become a key driver of Italian power prices. Italy’s focus on growing its renewable fleet will ease the pressure of global energy commodity price volatility on the country’s power prices. However, a low-wind winter, or cloudy summer, combined with a low hydro year could temporarily exacerbate Italy’s power price dependence on gas."}]}
