access has been a challenge for both site selection and transmission connection. Developers usually spend two years negotiating with land owners to acquire land. They also need to identify the successors of the registered owners in cases where they cannot be located, which is sometimes difficult. They are not permitted to use agricultural lands. Generally, it takes a long time for administrative processes including grid connection and negotiating a power purchase agreement. For small-scale renewable energy projects, the regulatory framework only requires a permit for those with a generation capacity of 1MW or larger. Regulations for on-site generation are relatively light-handed."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investments in Kenya have been sporadic in the last decade, sustained by a small number of financings for geothermal and wind projects. In 2019, Kenya recorded $728 million of total clean energy investment, a reduction of 42% compared to 2018,  of which $401 million was directed to biomass projects. The majority of financing for large-scale renewable energy projects comes from development financing and donor organizations. Distributed energy startups such as pay-as-you-go solar companies, microgrid and on-site energy developers received financing from more diverse financiers, including private investors, commercial banks and utilities."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"In December 2018, President Kenyatta said that Kenya planned to attain “100% green energy consumption by 2020”, but there has been no legislative action to set such a target. Kenyatta’s non-binding target appeared to include large hydro, which accounted for more than 28% of the country’s generation in 2019. Still, Kenya is gradually increasing its non-large hydro renewables by adding solar, wind and geothermal. By end-2019, the country achieved 93% of the target. The government no longer offers a feed-in tariff for these technologies after more than 4GW of capacity applied and which the grid system cannot absorb. The country is in the process of shifting from a feed-in tariff scheme to an auction-based one, but only for wind and solar energy. In September 2020, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) developed draft Energy Regulations 2020 along with the associated draft Regulatory Impact Statement, which will operationalize the Energy Act 2019. The auction regulation will be available in 2021."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Kenya’s peak power demand saw 5.6% growth from 2018 to 2019, reaching 1,900MW. It was driven by growing demand from residential customers that could benefit from a subsidized grid connection cost, and from commercial as well as industrial customers. Kenya Power introduced a night-time discounted tariff for commercial and industrial customers in December 2017. But, it has not stimulated consumers to increase power demand as intended, likely because of strict criteria for eligibility. Kenya has the largest off-grid solar market in Sub-Saharan Africa, and is poised to grow further under its National Electrification Strategy launched in December 2018, which aims to attain universal access by 2022."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The liberalization of the generation market has seen more than 10 independent power producers cut into KenGen’s market share. The government has also mandated Ketraco to compete with Kenya Power on transmission. In March 2019, the president signed Energy Bill 2017, which liberalized the electricity retail market on paper. But the market has been so far monopolized by Kenya Power in practice and it would take another year or more to set up detailed regulations. Large hydro and geothermal are the two main sources of Kenya’s generation mix. The share of non-large hydro renewables generation reached 60% in 2019 from 52.3% in 2018."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Kenya’s electricity tariffs are set by the Electricity Act of 2006. In 2019, while residential prices were up 3%, to $158/MWh, commercial prices saw a 7% reduction and industrial prices kept flat from 2018.  Kenya Power introduced off-peak tariffs for commercial and industrial customers in December 2017, which are applicable during the night time if a customer meets a certain threshold of monthly power consumption. Power prices in Kenya are higher compared to neighboring economies such as Ethiopia, where cheap large hydro is available, and Tanzania, where the government keeps tariffs lower than generation costs."}]}
