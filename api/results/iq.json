less than half of bill costs recouped in addition to subsidized power tariffs, incentives for IPPs to enter the market are low. Offtaker risk is present, with payments known to be delayed. The weak grid infrastructure throws a further spanner in the works for project developers. On a macro level, perceived political and country risks are high."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"While Iraq saw no new clean energy investment between 2010 and 2018, solar deals were recorded in 2019 and 2020. Financing renewables in Iraq is difficult, and private investors are forced to rely on local banks that lack experience in financing larger projects. Due to a variety of factors, such as the security situation, there is a high perception of risk surrounding investments in the country’s energy sector. The Ministry of Energy has tried to incentivize foreign developers to enter the renewables market with tax incentives. Projects in areas defined by the National Investment Council (NIC) are exempt from taxes and fees for 10 years from the date of completion. The NIC can also extend the period of exemption up to 15 years, if the Iraqi investor share of the project exceeds 50%."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Iraq is slowly expanding its portfolio of clean energy policies. The country aims to generate 10% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 under the country’s Integrated National Energy Strategy, with a longer-term goal of 40%. However, this target is a far cry from current nearly non-existent renewables capacity. In 2019, Iraq replaced its largely unsuccessful feed-in tariff scheme with auctions, tendering 755MW of PV capacity. The Covid-19 pandemic, however, has delayed the processing of the winning bids. Learning from an unsuccessful first solar tender in 2016, the 2019 tender included a range of benefits such as improved land access, fewer customs fees and sometimes also sovereign guarantees. There are plans to float a second 750MW auction toward the end of 2020."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"International industrials such as General Electric, Siemens and ABB are working with the Iraqi government to repair and upgrade power plants in an attempt to sustain current plant production and rehabilitate capacity damaged during years of conflict. The government also aims to strengthen the grid and reconnect areas in the north and west with the rest of the country. With demand growing 7% on average each year, further capacity will be necessary to avoid continued shortages."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Ministry of Electricity oversees all segments of the power sector via distinct entities. Over half of Iraqi power capacity is gas, with oil plants making up around a third of capacity. Despite over 2GW of large hydro capacity, just over half is available to generate due to damages and aging infrastructure. Electricity and gas imports from Iran help meet demand. Due to age, lack of maintenance and terrorist attacks, transmission and especially distribution are severely dilapidated, causing around three-quarters of generated electricity to be lost."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The government heavily subsidizes electricity and fuel prices, with tariffs remaining unchanged since 2017 at around $42/MWh. The supply of electricity is unreliable and available for less than 15 hours a day. This has forced consumers to turn to private, predominantly diesel, generators for supply."}]}
