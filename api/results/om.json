has a relatively stable and open business environment. In terms of the power sector, Oman has allowed 100% foreign ownership of companies and properties, and has begun privatizing its electricity companies. While these moves can attract investment to renewable energy projects, Oman’s fragmented renewable-energy policies could hinder the roll-out of renewables projects. A comprehensive renewable-energy regulatory framework could help better integrate renewables projects into different power-market players. Development of renewables projects other than solar and wind and smart grid technology may help the country transition to a more diversified and efficient power market."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Most of Oman’s renewable-energy projects have just entered the tender process or been announced, but the country is keen to invest in clean energy projects. A government-led subsidy program is in place for a residential rooftop solar PV pilot, and investment from other countries in the region has been injected to finance a utility-scale solar PV project. In addition, not only does Oman’s 2025 target of 3,050MW solar and wind projects require massive investment, but the Sultanate’s incumbent combined power-and-water-desalination plants – which were put in place 15-20 years ago – also need capital to upgrade or be replaced with more efficient gas plants, reverse osmosis water plants and solar power."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Oman has ambitious plans to transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy policy, with a target of 16% of electricity generation derived from renewable sources by 2025, and 30% by 2030 (starting from close to zero in 2018). To achieve these targets, the country has planned for renewable energy projects amounting to 3,050MW to be installed by 2025, including utility-scale solar and wind plus a smaller waste-to-energy plant. Over 1,600MW of solar projects have been auctioned as of September 2020. In addition, financial opportunities such as government-led subsidy for rooftop solar for residential customers and supports of foreign investment can spur renewable energy uptake in the country."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Peak power demand in Oman increased at a compound annual growth of about 8% from 2007 to 2017, primarily driven by a growing economy, rising population and the government’s focus on non-oil sectors. From 2018, the peak-demand growth rate declined to around 5% due to the introduction of the Cost Reflective Tariff for large industrial, commercial and government consumers in 2017. Commissioned renewables projects only accounted for less than 1% of installed capacity as of 2019, but Oman’s fuel diversification plan and support of finance could spur rollout."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Natural gas is the primary resource for power generation in Oman, accounting for over 97% of power output in 2019. The power mix will change dramatically in the next decade. Oman’s strategic plan for energy and economics aims for renewable energy sources to account for 30% of power generation. The country’s electricity and water procurement company (OPWP) aims to diversify fuels by introducing 3,050MW of renewable-energy projects by 2025 and 3,000MW of coal-power capacity by 2030. While little planned capacity has been installed, the implementation of the rest should move more quickly as Oman has finished financing a utility-scale solar PV project and initiated an auction for another two. Oman has passed laws to push for the privatization of power sector. The country has become the first in the region to privatize its transmission utility, Oman Electricity Transmission Company (OETC), by selling a 49% of stake to Chinese transmission and distribution operator State Grid Corp. of China (SGCC) in 2019. Oman is a part of the Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) grid interconnection system, which allows for electricity transfers between the six connected countries (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE and Oman). A 0.22 MW (220 kV) interconnection between the Oman (MIS) and UAE (Abu Dhabi) power systems has been commercially operational since 2012. While not used consistently, the link has provided emergency reserves on a number of occasions, preventing power failures in the MIS."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Similar to other countries in the region, Oman’s electricity prices are highly subsidized for residents. Prices paid by consumers were static from the early 1990s until 2017 and only covered about 54% of production costs. In 2017, the country introduced a cost-reflective tariff that removed subsidies for customers whose yearly use exceeds 150MWh (effectively commercial customers), charging them set prices based on typical demand profiles for the season and time of day. A planned spot market for wholesale electricity trading by 2019-2020 may also introduce more competition into the country’s power market, which would lower the cost of power."}]}
