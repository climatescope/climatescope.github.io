has faced many tragedies, including earthquakes and hurricanes, which have disabled most of its already weak electricity system. For instance, Haiti’s first microgrid was partially destroyed in Hurricane Matthew in late 2016. A total of 20% of the project’s PV panels and all its cabling and poles were destroyed. In addition, EDH is regarded as poorly managed and corrupt, which adds to the challenges of doing business in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Haiti lacks specific legislation mandating microgrids and this has both slowed project development and kept risks high. Regardless, microgrids are appearing on the island. One, financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the United Nations Environment Program and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), links the towns of Côteaux, Port-à-Piment and Roche-à-Bateaux and is managed by a newly created electrical cooperative. Another in Feyo Bien, is supported by IDB. Both microgrids are powered by hybrid PV-diesel generators. Sigora Solar has also developed a diesel generator-powered microgrid in Mole Saint Nicolas, to which it will add solar generation shortly. In 2019, the government of Haiti and the World Bank established a new financing instrument to incentivize private companies to develop clean off-grid energy projects in the country. With $17 million in funding, it aims to provide electricity to 200,000 households in the next 10 years."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Improving energy access is a central announced goal of Haiti President Jovenel Moïse. He has abolished import duties on wind and solar generation products as well as solar appliances as the government has adopted the Scaling-up Renewable Energy Plan (SREP) with advice from the Climate Investment Fund. In addition, the country has established a voluntary clean energy target on its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). It aims to increase to 47% the share of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with 24.5% to come from hydro, 9.4% wind, 7.5% solar and 5.6% biomass. Grants and projects have focused on restructuring Haiti’s national power company Electricité d’Haiti (EDH). On a smaller scale, microgrid projects are appearing across the island. On September 13, 2019, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) launched a tender for the construction of three microgrids in Capotille, Vallières and Mont-Organisé cities, as part of its Rural Electrification and Women Empowerment project. In January 2018, Haiti announced it is opening its generation, transmission and distribution sectors to private participation in eight regions of the country by awarding concessions. As of the end of September 2019, the government had opened the pre-qualification process for companies interested in providing power services in Miragoâne, Les Cayes and Caracol."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Haiti has limited energy-related policies. The 2017-2018 Finance Act abolished all import duty taxes on PV generation equipment, wind generation equipment, and solar powered off-grid home appliances such as refrigerators, lamps and chargers. Only a quarter of the population has access to on-grid electricity. The national grid shortfalls have created opportunities for distributed clean energy generation solutions and the implementation of microgrids. With the help of a grant from USAID, EarthSpark was responsible for developing Haiti’s first microgrid, which started operation in the south of the country in 2015, providing solar power to around 450 households in the city of Les Anglais. The system relies on batteries to ensure reliability and smart meters for system stability and to facilitate pre-pay capability for its customers."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Haiti has 284MW of installed capacity, with the bulk (80%) represented by fossil fuels. The remaining 20% comes from the Péligre hydro plant, which is undergoing restoration, and other small hydro plants. EDH owns 44% of capacity in Haiti and operates Haiti’s 1,500 km of distribution lines. EDH is able to power Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince and a few cities nearby, but only intermittently due to insufficient infrastructure. Meanwhile, the use of diesel generators, kerosene lamps and other forms of off-grid technologies is commonplace. EDH has received grants from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and other international organizations to help the country improve its infrastructure."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Haiti have remained flat since 2009.
