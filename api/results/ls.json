is created by a number of overlapping energy-sector entities, including the Department of Energy, Lesotho Electricity Co., Lesotho Energy and Water Authority and Rural Electrification Unit, which

There is also limited availability of suitable land for renewable energy development – the terrain is mountainous and access is difficult, and where it is accessible it is often already being used for agriculture or settlement."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Some 90MW of renewables are under development, with power offtake agreements in place. The 20MW NEO1 Solar project has been financed by the African Development Bank/World Bank, and the 70MW NEO2 Solar project has been financed and developed by China’s Exim bank. When completed, they would more than double Lesotho's fleet size.

A draft renewable energy framework policy has also been developed, including mechanisms for procuring both off-grid and on-grid renewable energy, but this has not been adopted either. There are no specific regulations for off-grid renewables deployment. The country has set an electricity-access target of 40% of the population by 2020, renewable energy being one of the main tools proposed to achieve this. According to the Lesotho Energy and Water Authority (LEWA) the country has achieved its target and in 2019 the national electrification rate was of 43%."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Data indicates that Lesotho's electrification rate has advanced from 17% in 2015 to almost 43% in 2019.

In 2018, Lesotho imported 30% of its power from neighboring South Africa. While its domestic fleet is composed entirely of hydro, South Africa's grid is composed of 90% coal power. Between its domestic production and imports, Lesotho's average carbon intensity is about 0.218 CO2 kg/KWh. Expansion of its domestic fleet with renewable energy will reduce import volumes and lower the carbon footprint of the power sector. The country has a strong financial incentive to do so, as imported electricity costs 10 times as much as domestically produced power."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices are extremely high in Lesotho. They were $0.77 per KWh in 2018, on a weighted-average basis, and in 2019 prices increased between 3% and 3.8% for all customer categories. Prices are elevated by the need to procure imports from South Africa. A growing domestic fleet, with low marginal-cost electricity, should help reduce local power prices."}]}
