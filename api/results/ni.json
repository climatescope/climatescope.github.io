general lack of direct policy supports for renewables is likely to inhibit the sector’s growth in the country for the foreseeable future.

Nonetheless, very high power prices make it difficult to attract new business to the country. Moreover, the fragile condition of Nicaragua’s transmission system jeopardizes service reliability."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Nicaragua enjoyed a clean energy investment boom during the first half of the 2010’s. The country attracted $942 million for new projects from 2010-16. Wind projects accounted for a third of the total, followed by small hydro with $218 million and geothermal with $215 million. The years since have been considerably quieter with no meaningful investment in projects registered in 2017-18 and just $2.1 million for solar projects in 2019."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The Nicaragua Ministry of Energy and Mines updated in January 2017 the country’s Plan for Electric Generation Expansion 2016-2030, with a non-binding 73% by 2030 renewables generation target (including large hydro). The plan also sets an interim renewables goal of 64% by 2023. In 2018, the country achieved 58% with wind and geothermal the biggest contributors at 17% apiece. Renewable energy developers enjoy a full range of tax breaks in Nicaragua, including exemptions on import duties, value-added taxes and income taxes. In addition, in January 2018 the government unveiled net metering rules that allow owners of PV systems up to 5MW in size to sell their surplus power back to Nicaragua’s distribution companies."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Peak demand for power in Nicaragua jumped 28% from 2010-18. Growth then decelerated to just 1% per year from 2015-2018 due to slower economic growth. In 2019, however, peak demand set a new record at 718MW.

Fossil-fueled plants still play an important, albeit somewhat diminished, role in the country’s power sector at 43% of 2019 generation. Nicaragua's power sector is unbundled and distinct actors (both state- and privately owned) participate in the generation and distribution sectors. At least 18 companies hold active generation contracts today for projects they own. Nicaragua is part of the Central American Electrical Interconnected System (SIEPAC) and is connected to El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras by transmission lines."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"From 2018 to 2019, commercial power prices in Nicaragua rose 12% to reach $271/MWh, the highest in Latin America. Industrial tariffs spiked from $176/MWh to $192/MWh and at $198/MWh, Nicaragua’s residential power prices are in the top quartile in the region. The country’s continuing reliance on imported fossil fuels for generation is largely to blame for the high-cost power. Renewables development represents a potential path to greater energy independence and lower-priced power."}]}
