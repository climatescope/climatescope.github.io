much like other sub-Saharan countries, has introduced import duty exemptions for equipment and machinery including solar panels and inverters. The Manufacturing Investment Incentive is a broad policy to bolster the manufacturing sector. The incentives make no special provision for the renewables industry but do present an opportunity to develop a manufacturing industry, provided that the local market becomes more stable. Offtaker risk poses a potential hurdle to this market, as the BPC has historically run at a loss. However, more recently the BPC has managed to reduce its losses to a minimum under the guidance of the CEO, Stefan Schwarzfischer. Unlike its neighbors, Botswana has little currency risk with the pula strengthening against the dollar."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Only one grid-scale renewable energy project has been commissioned in Botswana to date â€“ the 1.3MW solar PV project close to Phakalane. It was financed through a $12.5 million grant from the Japanese government. This is the only utility-scale renewable project to be financed in the last five years, making the current share of foreign investment 100%. Botswana is open to foreign investment, but many project developers are unable to prepare the project proposals that meet the criteria necessary to attract international finance, according to the World Bank."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Historically, Botswana has lacked the legal framework and incentives to develop its renewable energy industry, with the National Energy Policy remaining in draft form since October 2009. An ambitious tender for 100MW of solar PV capacity announced in 2017 was canceled in May 2019. The tender was reissued and redefined in late 2019 as two 50MW IPP projects. Procurement has been initiated on 12 grid-connected, solar- and diesel-powered mini-grids of total capacity up to 35 MW. Both solar PV and mini-grid tenders are expected to have contracted with developers by the end of 2020, although Covid-19 related closures have cast this timeline into doubt. Import and tax incentives apply to a wide range of manufacturing goods and there are no specific provisions for the renewables industry."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Botswana boasts an impressive electrification rate of 67%. Botswana's power demand has plateaued in recent years, sitting at 610MW for the last three years. Demand has peaked due to a slowdown in mining as a result of the commoditiesâ€™ price slump, whereby the largest state mine in the country filed for liquidation in 2016 and halted all operations. BPC has an aging power plant fleet with the oldest plant commissioned in the late 1980s. Refurbishment of the Morupule A coal plant has experienced numerous delays while Morupule B has proved prone to breakdowns."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal dominates Botswanaâ€™s power sector, accounting for 82% of the current installed capacity. By contrast, solar PV accounts for just 0.1%, although this is expected to change with the development of a 100MW solar project that was reissued in May 2019. Botswana has gradually weaned itself off dependency on imports from the SAAP, and it now imports only 23% of the distributed power nationally. There is only one operational 1.3MW solar plant in the country, and renewables do not benefit from purchase obligation as BPC buys all the power available regardless of sector. Currently, the Botswana Power Corporation is the sole provider of generation, transmission, distribution and retail services. However, BPC is looking to transform itself into a transmission and distribution utility, and move away from being a fully integrated utility. Independent power producers (IPP) have been allowed to enter the market since 2007 but have only began to expand into the generation market in the last three years with the signing of two PPAs for the Morupule B Coal plant and a 1MW solar plant in 2017."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"For decades, electricity in Botswana has been heavily subsidized, but this is slowly changing with tariffs having increased in recent years. Private consumers have paid low power prices, which has led to the Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) dispatching power at a loss. In an effort to create more cost-reflective tariffs, BPC has therefore gradually increased the tariffs and steadily reduced the subsidy from 2.4 billion Botswana pula ($220 million) to 1.4 billion Botswana pula and reduced it further to 800 million Botswana pula in 2019. Electricity tariffs have risen consistently over the last decade at an average of 10% annually."}]}
