risk for power projects in the DRC is very high as SNEL, the state-owned utility, is not solvent. SNEL owns 94% of total installed capacity. This means the prospects for wind and solar developers to build new projects in the country are not very good, due to the high offtaker risk, pricing, currency volatility and political uncertainty. Additionally, poor energy infrastructure, particularly in the area of power transmission and distribution systems, makes it difficult for new entrants to scale up power production across a wider network. The DRC does not yet have any meaningful renewable energy incentives in place. Given the lack of utility-scale energy projects built in recent years, developers would also face a substantial amount of red tape. The DRC has no manufacturing capacity of any scale for its hydro or other renewable energy projects, so local content requirements do not exist. Smaller-scale companies also face import duties on off-grid solar products, unless they are granted an exemption."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in clean energy projects in the DRC has been limited for a number of reasons. The lack of a proper legal instrument to define the energy sector discourages investors from funding new projects. In Kananga, a private consortium composed of the DRC’s 7th Engineering and South Africa’s Megatron built a 2.5 MW solar PV plant in 2015. The plant operated for 12 months as a joint venture between Megatron and SNEL, with the former generating power, the latter distributing and selling, and the two sharing the proceeds. The plant shut down due to SNEL’s apparent failure to collect tariffs. In addition, the dominance of the highly subsidized, state-backed company, SNEL, in the generation, transmission and distribution of power make the investment climate less competitive. The absence of government regulation and energy policy on renewable energy does not encourage long-term capital investment in the renewable energy sector."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in January 2019 had its first democratic transfer of power since independence after a controversial election held in December 2018. The country’s National Assembly, however, is still dominated by the opposition party, which was previously led by the former president Joseph Kabila. This has led to a power sharing agreement where the opposition is able to appoint some ministers and heads of government institutions. This agreement could complicate the new government’s ability to implement new sweeping policies to overhaul the country’s power sector. The key focus of the government is increasing accessibility to electricity to about 30% by 2030. The country has no specific policies on renewable energy. Tax incentives for renewable energy projects are the sole area where policy directly benefits the industry."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Mining activity will drive near-term growth in power demand in the DRC, in part due to the increase in global demand for specialty metals such as copper and cobalt, which the country has in abundant supply. Copperbelt Energy’s plans to build two grid-connected solar PV projects for the mining sector are evidence of this. The government plans to triple the current national electrification rate to 32% by 2030 and this is likely to mean favorable policies will be introduced for mini-grids or off-grid solar. Most DRC power plants are hydroelectric stations that do not require near-term upgrades. Once the liberalization of the energy sector is completed, mining companies can independently produce or procure, which could force SNEL to operate competitively. However, mini-grid and off-grid are also expected to grow in the coming years as household demand increases."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"There has been much discussion about constructing Inga III. The government selected two consortia for the task: one including Spain’s Actividades de Construccion Servicios and AEE Power, and the other led by Three Gorges Corporation. In 2017 the government requested that the two consortia merge their proposals. They did so, and have since proposed building a much bigger version of Inga III, capable of generating 11,000MW, for $13.9 billion. It remains to be seen if this project will be developed. As yet, there are no utility-scale wind and solar projects, although there is some evidence this could change: Nuru deployed Congo's first solar-based mini-grid in 2017 and is currently constructing a 1.3MW solar hybrid site in Goma, the largest off-grid mini-grid in sub-Saharan Africa. Power generation still largely rests in the hands of state-controlled utility SNEL."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The DRC has a regulated electricity tariff that has only marginally changed since 2009. Residential customers are charged one of the lowest tariffs in the world, which does not even cover the operating costs of the utility, SNEL. However, there have been recent increases to residential tariffs due to a devaluation in the Congolese franc, according to reports. There has been little change to the levelized costs of electricity in the DRC due to a lack of new projects being built in the last 36 years and poor maintenance of existing energy infrastructure. Electricity is mostly purchased by consumers for a fixed lump sum as meters are very scarce, leaving much of the billing at the discretion of officials. Furthermore, it is also common for public institutions (schools, health centers and public enterprises) to have large amounts overdue on their electricity bills."}]}
