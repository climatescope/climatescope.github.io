barriers to invest in Australian power generation remain low. However, recent issues on the grid are making it more challenging to connect large-scale assets on the East Coast of the country. Policy and market uncertainties have reduced the length and certainty in offtake agreements in recent years, with many new projects now seeking to operate on a quasi-merchant or fully merchant basis. Foreign investors in large and/or key infrastructure projects must proceed through a review process, but to date, this has only resulted in the knock back of planned acquisitions in certain distribution network assets."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in Australian clean energy has seen a boom and bust over the past decade. Small-scale investments, supported by state-based feed-in tariffs and a federal SRES program, have frequently outpaced large-scale assets on an annual basis. Large-scale investment soared to new heights in 2017-18 after years of policy uncertainty which froze investment but then caused a rush-to-market of companies looking to secure sufficient capacity under the LRET policy. Sovereign capital plays a limited but important role in investments, with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency seeking to catalyze private capital into clean energy."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Australia has had a plethora of renewable energy policies over the years, both enforced and proposed. Its existing flagship policy, the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET), has largely run its course – driving an explosion of investment over 2017-18  , with enough capacity now secured to reach its legislated 33TWh target by 2030. A patch work of smaller programs, such as the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme(SRES) and state-based auctions, will continue to support new investment, but lack the muscle of a comprehensive federal policy. Combative federal politics means new supportive policy is not likely in the near term."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity demand in Australia remains substantially flat, following a period of softening demand around 2010. The rapid and seemingly unstoppable influx of behind-the-meter solar generation continues to put downward price pressure   on grid served electricity, particularly in the middle of the day. In more remote areas of the country, falling renewable energy costs are spurring a re-think of remote electricity infrastructure, with rising interest in the role of micro-grids in certain locations. But demand for these services are dwarfed by the main networks, which already service roughly 90-95% of power consumption in the country."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Despite a rapid influx of new renewable energy generators, coal generation still makes up the backbone of Australian electricity. But, the share of coal is dwindling as assets age, or are squeezed out of the market by cheaper renewable energy projects. Increasing intra-day volatility in spot electricity prices, and a greater need for improved system strength, are signalling the need for more flexible capacity to enter the market. Policy makers and regulators have put forward a series of packages that would support additional investment in dispatchable technologies like gas, batteries or pumped hydro. However, many market participants remain wary of a lurch back to direct government intervention in a market which has become highly liberalized and privatized."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Australia’s wholesale electricity markets have been extremely volatile over the past decade. Spot prices were low in 2011, due to an oversupply of generation. What followed was a period of capacity closures, rising fuel prices and failures in transmission assets, which drove average electricity prices to over A$150/MWh in some states by 2017. Spot prices have since softened; following the introduction of a raft of new policies aiming to bring down prices, a rapid build out of new renewable energy generation and a softening in fuel prices (particularly domestic gas and coal). Retail electricity rates paid by households remain stubbornly high, and are often among the highest in OECD countries. This is in part due to expensive network costs, which can make up to 40% of a household’s electricity bill."}]}
