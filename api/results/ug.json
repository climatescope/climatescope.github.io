recent large-scale power projects have been dogged by allegations of corruption and opaque procurement practices. These include the 600MW Karuma and the 183MW Isimba projects, which were directly awarded to Chinese developers by a presidential decision in 2014. Uganda already has more than 1.2GW of commissioned capacity against peak load of approximately half of that amount, creating a situation of significant oversupply that will make developing further generation projects more difficult. Many donor agencies have curbed investment or set more stringent compliance guidelines for unlocking further funding. Transmission availability can be a significant risk for projects, with commissioning of transmission frequently lagging generation assets like Karuma, which is completed but awaiting interconnection. Projects with take-or-pay contracts are equally exposed to such risks if they are not connected to the grid. As a landlocked country, Uganda must import many power components overland from the port of Mombasa, Kenya, which raises costs and extends project timelines. And while many of these components are exempt from the country’s VAT, unclear guidance and enforcement prevents developers from benefiting from preferential tariff treatment as much as the government intended. While modules and solar batteries are exempt, other solar components that have applications outside of generation are not and can be subject to the 18% tax when imported independently of PV systems. Large-scale components required to build a wind farm are also not exempt, making wind a relatively more expensive technology. No wind farms have been developed in Uganda to date. A new local content law adopted in 2020 creates an obligation to give preference to local goods and services. It also creates a requirement to employ Ugandans and limits the employment of non-citizens."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Uganda continues to develop its abundant hydro resources, pushing the power sector further down a low-carbon trajectory. The country's outlook for procuring other renewables such as wind and solar is more mixed. Uganda organized a successful feed-in tariff program that led to development of the region's largest solar projects outside of South Africa. However, government decisions to contract several massive hydro projects have raised concern about oversupply and dampened prospects for future wind and solar procurement. The 600MW Karuma hydro project is expected online by the end of 2020, and some of the country's oldest power plants have undergone retrofits in recent years. Investment and policy is expected to focus on expanding access via off-grid generation, as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure, rather than on growing renewable capacity."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Uganda has achieved its renewable energy generation target and its renewable capacity target for all technologies except for large hydro (813MW against a target of 1,200MW) and geothermal (zero against a target of 45MW). The country generates more than 90% of its power from renewable sources, including large hydro and biomass, and has 1,150MW of renewables connected to the grid. Uganda’s highly successful Global Energy Transfer feed-in tariff (GET FiT) program launched in 2014, becoming the first competitive auction program for renewables in East Africa. However, there is no auction program in force at the moment and none are planned, as the country has significant overcapacity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"An oversupplied market and lagging transmission and distribution infrastructure are reducing activity in Uganda’s power-generation sector. The most promising on-grid investment opportunities today involve building wires to transmit power to where it is needed most. Offtakers are generally secure in receiving payments for contracted power. The transmission system operator, UETCL, is the sole offtaker for all grid-connected power in the country. Grid-connected projects to date have signed 'deemed energy' (take-or-pay) contracts, and UETCL's commitments are understood to be backstopped by the Ministry of Finance. As long as projects are delivering to UETCL at the designated delivery point, they are paid whether or not UETCL is able to evacuate the power. This has increased the ability of projects to secure finance and increased their profitability. Rural electrification and distributed energy are also booming. Uganda has a thriving off-grid solar industry, with many companies using pay-as-you-go and mobile money applications to power explosive growth. Most of Uganda's energy access initiatives are focused on rural electrification, as a large portion of the country's capital, Kampala, already has grid access. The national electrification rate is low at 28%, while the rural electrification rate stands at just 8%. The country has introduced various strategies and plans with universal access targets that range from 2030 to 2040."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Uganda began unbundling its power market at the turn of the century, splitting up the utility’s generation, distribution and transmission arms. To date, more than ten different independent power producers (IPPs) have commissioned projects on the grid. They compete alongside the state developer, Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL). The country's transmission remains under state monopoly, with the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) being the sole operator of the system. Distribution is liberalized, with Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited (UEDCL) licensing eight different electricity distribution companies; however, Umeme Limited controls almost all of the retail electricity sales on the grid via a concession with UEDCL. Concessions are granted to other distributors in areas of the country outside of Umeme’s concession as sole providers of electricity in these regions. Customers cannot choose from whom to purchase electricity. The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) oversees all three segments of the power sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Uganda has relatively high retail prices compared to neighboring countries. This is largely due to the combination of cost overruns and expensive take-or-pay contracts with renewable (mostly large-scale hydro) projects. Umeme, the country’s transmission and distribution utility, guarantees shareholders a 20% return on investment, further boosting prices. Residential, industrial and commercial rates have all increased more than 50% in real terms since 2010."}]}
