Over a third of that capital was directed to small hydro plants ($0.8 billion), followed by geothermal with $0.6 billion and wind with $0.6 billion.

To put that latter goal in context, in 2019, 99.8% of Costa Rica’s generation came from clean sources, including large hydro.

However, high hydro penetration and slow demand growth have curtailed opportunities for new entrants. With typically around 70% of the country’s power coming from hydro, the need to add other clean generation to achieve the national 100% renewable energy goal is limited."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The power market in Costa Rica is regulated and dominated by vertically-integrated Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), the country’s major generator and sole power purchaser. However, the Costa Rican market allows private participation in the form of cooperatives and independent power producers. These entities can be involved with generation and distribution in some parts of the country. In 2019, Costa Rica had an installed capacity of 3,637MW, with hydropower representing almost 65% (2,360MW) of the total. Oil-fired capacity slipped to 474MW, or 13% of capacity, from 572MW, or 16% of capacity in 2018. Wind represents 11% (411MW) of current capacity. More geothermal capacity was added in 2019 than any other technology with 50MW brought online. Geothermal now accounts for 7% of Costa Rica’s total capacity.  Generation in 2019 totaled 11,313GWh, thanks primarily to hydropower with 69% (7,827GWh), followed by wind with 16% (1,796GWh) and geothermal with 13% (1,513GWh)."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Costa Rica power prices rose in 2016 due to heavy use of diesel-fired generation to satisfy a 6.6% jump in electricity demand.

Commercial prices went from $186.9/MWh in 2018 to $197.09/MWh in 2019. Industrial prices were least affected, rising 5% year-on-year."}]}
