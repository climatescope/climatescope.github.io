ENEE faces serious financial problems and has renegotiated earlier feed-in premiums with domestic and foreign companies owning clean energy projects in Honduras. In late 2018, the Honduran government announced an agreement to renegotiate the contracts. However, only domestic companies accepted the $0.03/kWh tariff cut. Meanwhile, ENEE continues to grapple with financial challenges. In addition, the Honduras transmission network remains shaky. On September 16, 2019, a blackout affected most SIEPAC countries and Mexico. The cause was said to be heavy storms in Honduras.

PV projects up to 300MW in size installed by July 31, 2015 were eligible to receive a base price for their energy equal to the short-term marginal cost plus $0.03/kWh plus 10%.
