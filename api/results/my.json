investors are not allowed to have majority share-holding in renewable energy assets in the country. This forces foreign companies to tie up with local partners to participate in auctions and other feed-in tariff projects. Additionally, feed-in tariff projects are incentivized to use locally sourced equipment by providing bonus tariffs. Land for large-scale projects is a growing constraint, as much of the available acreage is high-value agricultural land. The average electricity tariff for residential consumers is significantly lower than that for commercial and industrial consumers. The electricity tariffs in the country have been left unchanged for the last five years. This makes it difficult for solar rooftop projects to compete in the residential segment."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The various policy initiatives like feed-in tariffs and auctions, along with tax and other incentives like the Green Technology Financing Scheme, have contributed to the growth of clean-energy investments. About $0.3 billion went into renewable energy projects in Malaysia in 2019. Solar projects continue to garner the most interest, biogas and small hydro have good potential, and biomass consists of mostly legacy assets. In June 2017, the country also issued the world’s first green sukuk (Islamic) bond, which was used to finance large-scale solar projects awarded under the first auction for that technology. Investments may pick up in the next few years on the back of government auctions and the new plan to promote rooftop PV projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Malaysia passed the Renewable Energy Act in June 2011, and followed it up with the Renewable Energy (Feed-in Approval and Feed-in Tariff Rate) Rules in the same year. Solar PV, small hydro, biomass and biogas projects were allowed to apply for feed-in tariffs. In 2016, the government announced rules for auctions of large-scale solar power projects (greater than 30MW capacity). The country has conducted three rounds of auctions to date. As part of the country’s Covid-19 economic recovery package, the government initiated a 1GW solar power auction in 2020. In 2018, Malaysia announced a target of receiving 20% of its electricity generation from renewable energy by 2025. This target is ambitious but lower than those set by other major markets across the world. Successive governments have, however, ensured continuity in the country’s push to promote renewable energy."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Average power demand in Malaysia has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 4% since 2010. The country achieved 100% electrification in 2015. The long-term economic growth prospects of the country offers further potential for power demand growth, and the government targets to ramp up solar power capacity to meet this demand at least partially. The country has a potential for 42GW of rooftop solar power capacity, and 16.5GW of solar on water bodies. Malaysia is also the third-largest PV cell producer in the world. The average age of power generation assets in the country is still low, therefore Malaysia does not have a program to modernize power plants."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal and gas dominate power generation in Malaysia, and accounted for 75% of the installed capacity and 83% of electricity generation in 2019. This share has largely remained stagnant despite the government’s efforts to promote renewable energy. A number of projects awarded under the three large-scale auctions completed during 2016-19 are expected to be commissioned in the next two years. The government is also awarding an additional 1GW of new projects in the fourth round of auctions. These projects will help increase the share of solar in installed generation capacity, and power generation, in the next three to four years. The electricity sector is partially unbundled, with private participation allowed in electricity generation. Independent power producers account for about 70% of all power generation assets in Malaysia. The three state-owned utilities – TNB, Serawak Energy and Sabah Electricity – are the only entities allowed to participate in electricity transmission and distribution."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Malaysian residential electricity is among the cheapest in the region at $53/MWh, while commercial and industrial tariffs are higher, at $92-105/MWh. Average power prices have remained the same across all segments for the last four years. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for renewable technologies is still not competitive with conventional generation assets like coal and gas power. Small hydropower projects offer the cheapest renewable energy generation technology, followed by solar. However, in the auctions held under Malaysia’s third round of large-scale solar auctions, the lowest bid for solar power came in at 177 ringgits ($42)/MWh. The government expects the new 1GW mega-tender to further drive down prices in 2020-21."}]}
