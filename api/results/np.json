aims to increase foreign investments in the energy sector, both in hydro and non-hydro renewable energy. Currently, the country has not been able to attract significant investment mainly because of the high risks related to the offtaker , curtailment and foreign exchange, as well as inadequate infrastructure and cumbersome government procedures. Projects under construction could be put on hold because of natural disaster and pandemic control in the country. Tariffs are not always considered to be sufficient to payback investors within a reasonable timeframe. As for foreign direct investment, China is now a new entrant with mature hydro technology and capital, but the cultural attachment of Nepal with India might prevent Chinese influence from going deeper."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Various funds have been set up by the government for the development of renewables, such as the Central Renewable Energy Fund and the Small Hydro Power Fund. However, the official authorities admitted that the lack of mobilization of credit and high dependence on subsidy has been hampering further investments in renewable energy. With huge potential of hydro and some wind,solar available, the country focuses on attracting foreign investors and drawing private players into the market. International donors such as World Bank, Asian Development Bank and UN have financed projects in the past, and policies and subsidies have been introduced to promote foreign direct investments as well. The country needs to attract more than 28 trillion Nepalese rupees ($268 billion) in foreign capital into the energy sector by 2045, according to estimates quoted in Nepal’s Investment Summit. China became a new major investor in Nepal with its own hydro technology and funding."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Nepal’s National Rural and Renewable Energy Program of 2012 targeted 25MW of mini and micro hydro and 600,000 solar home systems. It also set goals for biogas, water pumps and solar cookers. In general the subsidies starting in 2012 were generous and ambitious, but the program has not brought about significant new-build in the renewables sector. The Renewable Energy Subsidy Policy 2016 in force today is relatively stable and clear for market entrants. Technologies that are qualified for subsidies include mini- to small-hydro and improved water mills, solar PV, solar thermal, biogas, biomass, wind, as well as solar-wind hybrid systems. It provides different levels of subsidy to those areas with national grid access or off-grid. The rates are rarely adjusted, and not cost-reflective. No auction or power market is in place. A lot of plans have been initiated to attract investments by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA, celebrating its 35th anniversary in 2020), but progress has been slow."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Nepalese power generation has grown by close to 10% in fiscal 2018-19 and 19% in 2019-20. Both rates are impressive. Power consumption also recorded a 3% increase. The shortage of power has become one of the barriers to better economic growth. The electrification rate stands at less than 90% now, but the target is for 100% by 2030. As the country recovers from the Covid-19 hit, it will need more power and provide opportunities for related businesses. Nowadays, only 2% of the total estimated 42GW of hydro resource is tapped. At this level of availability, and with the regular speed of development, the expected consumption of 17,400GWh by 2027 may not be met. Nepal adopts the Common Law system and has satisfactory data transparency in the field of electricity."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Hydro is the main (99%) power generating source in Nepal. No fossil fuel is used for the purpose of powering the Himalayan country, except diesel, which is used for back-up generators widely adopted in facilities and at home. While hydro has zero emissions, Nepal experiences serious shortage of power: many people remain with restricted access to electricity, and those with access have regular or irregular blackouts. This is likely to change, as the country intends to build more hydro and introduce solar PV. Its power generation and transmission is largely bundled and dominated by a single state-owned entity - Nepal Electricity Authority or NEA. Although some independent power producers exist, the country wishes to introduce more in order to increase supply. So far Nepal imports power regularly from India, especially during the dry season. It does not have a domestic power market yet."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"According to NEA’s annual report, its average price of electricity sold was 10.62 rupees/kWh in fiscal 2019-20, or 0.26% lower than the previous year. Whereas the country’s average power tariff paid is 7.22 rupees/kWh to local IPPs and 7.86 rupees to India. The price could keep relatively stable, because any tariff-petition adjustment from NEA needs to go through the regulatory body in the government. The sales price is relatively low compared to neighboring countries such as India, mainly because hydro dominates Nepalese capacity mix and runs on low marginal cost. In 2019-20, NEA achieved a net profit (mainly due to better power sales) of 11,056 million rupees, or 12.36% up from the previous year. It thus successfully reduced accumulated losses down to 4,866 million rupees."}]}
