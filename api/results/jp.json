The boom between 2013 and 2015 was mainly due to the generous subsidy scheme. As the tariff rates dropped and competitive auctions became the norm, the investment volume also plunged. With the shift to the feed-in premium scheme from 2022, new investment to solar may be further limited while offshore wind could make up for the loss of solar, depending on the design of site tenders and grid connection."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Japan’s renewable energy goals have not been revised since 2014. The target share of renewable energy in the 2030 generation mix is 22-24%. Since the introduction of feed-in tariffs in 2012, wind and solar generation has increased to 9% of total generation while piling up the feed-in tariff deficit.   Therefore, the competitive auction scheme was introduced, first for solar projects in 2017, then biomass in 2018 and is scheduled for onshore wind in 2021. In the next step, the government has decided to shift from a feed-in tariff to a feed-in premium from 2022 onwards. Project owners will need to manage balancing and price volatility under the new scheme. The subsidy linkage to the wholesale spot market could lower the bankability and revenue predictability of new solar projects, limiting market entry for new players. The government may no longer focus on just solar, given the high penetration of solar in renewable generation. Instead, offshore wind has been gaining momentum in terms of project announcements and development, backed by strong support from the regulator. Despite its lack of target capacity, the government has designated four offshore wind sites, and plans to increase the count to at least five sites by 2030. In July 2020, the government announced plans to phase out 100 inefficient coal power plants by 2030 without details, and did not define inefficiency. On nuclear, the safety review process has become even slower since the pandemic in 2020. The nuclear policy, which is no-new-build, has remained the same since 2014. Despite the challenges with nuclear restarts and coal phase-out policy, the government has designed market mechanisms favorable to nuclear and fossil plants under the power market reform, including baseload market and capacity market."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand is expected to fall due to the shrinking population, high energy efficiency and slowdown in economy."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The vast majority of generation assets – which could be higher than 85% – are owned by the incumbent utilities, which makes it difficult for new entrants to compete in retail markets. As power demand is expected to fall amid the shrinking population and slowdown in economy, opportunities for new capacity additions are very limited except for the replacement of retired old capacity. Coal and gas account for 68% of generation. The growth in solar capacity is expected to be the largest in 2020 - we expect 7GW of capacity to be added. Japan has 10 different power markets and each region is poorly connected, resulting in price distortion between east and west regions in the wholesale market."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The power retail price has been rising despite retail market deregulation in April 2016, due to a combination of different factors including the slow restart of nuclear reactors, the generous historic feed-in tariff rates coupled with growing renewables and Japan’s reliance on fossil fuel imports with rising commodity prices. In 2020, there may be a drop in the power price as oil prices are low. The levelized cost of electricity for solar and wind in Japan has been the world's highest. Capex and opex may fall to some extent but not enough to reach the global average."}]}
