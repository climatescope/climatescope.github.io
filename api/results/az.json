provides tax breaks on imported renewable-energy equipment, and it has a domestic solar-panel factory. There have not been any renewables auctions, and the market is still awaiting on a standardized PPA process. The tenders that have been arranged do not have local content requirements or limit the ability of foreign companies to compete. This relatively open approach to renewables development is balanced by a slightly harder-to-navigate administrative system. Each project so far has been the object of negotiations with the authorities. The government has an informal target of 30% renewable generation by 2030, yet it’s unlegislated and it’s uncertain how high a priority it is."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The growth rate of renewables investment has been very small and largely focused on onshore wind and some solar. Investments have been supported by international development institutions like the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), as have many of the regulatory and legislative reforms aimed at stimulating investment. Financing has been made available to local banks through the development institutions. Royal Dutch Shell and Equinor have expressed interest in supporting or investing in renewables development in the country. Their existing experience in Azerbaijan means that they have a distinct advantage due to their familiarity with the relevant power authorities."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Azerbaijan’s renewables market is still in the early stages of development. The country is working toward a low 20% renewable generation target, and has awarded contracts to meet this. Feed-in tariffs are negotiated on a project-by-project basis, as rates paid by the state-owned utility for renewables generation would otherwise make investment unprofitable. The government is developing a standardized power purchase agreement (PPA) to amend this and help it meet its unofficial 30% renewable generation target by 2030. Oil and gas companies, which have long operated in Azerbaijan, may well be among the most serious contenders in the medium term. Larger utilities from abroad have been slow to show interest in investing in renewables in the country; however, the government is working hard to change this."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand decreased significantly in Azerbaijan and many other Soviet republics as industrial production fell after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Power demand has been rising in recent years as the economy has grown, although the relationship will ultimately decouple with economic growth expected to outstrip growth in power demand. Economic growth depends largely on oil and gas exports, and increased efficiency in energy use will further disconnect the two. The country is reforming legislation to strengthen the current power system and market. The electrification rate is 100%, so off-grid and mini-grid potential would appear to be limited. The potential for mini-grid development to increase energy security and stability of the system is not yet under consideration."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Gas accounts for the largest share of generation in Azerbaijan, with hydropower a distant second and renewables having only a small impact. The country is self-sufficient in energy, although the interconnectors with neighboring countries allow for some imports and exports. Renewables projects do not benefit from priority dispatch, although the state-owned power company does have some obligations in the purchase of power. The power market is not unbundled but is controlled by the central government. Efforts are under way to reform this, with DNV-GL acting as a consultant to the government, and with support from development institutions. There is no market for PPAs (power purchase agreements); however, the government is working alongside the EBRD to develop a standard framework."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices have significantly increased in recent years, as the government has attempted to shore up the viability of the power system. Soviet-era networks and generation assets require upgrades and will have to be supported by higher power prices. The issues with subsidized power prices and antiquated installations are common to most of Azerbaijan’s neighbors, with which it has interconnections. Generation is largely fueled by the country’s own natural gas, so costs will decline as power plants are upgraded to more efficient turbines. Gas may well present renewables with strong competition for a while to come."}]}
