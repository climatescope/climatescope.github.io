concerns inhibit project development in Niger and weaken the market’s attractiveness to investors. In addition, the country offers little in terms of incentivizing policies or a robust regulatory framework for renewables, nor an accompanying clean energy value chain. Project costs are also much higher outside of the capital Niamey and bureaucratic constraints further contribute to a lack of market transparency. Low electricity tariffs and the population’s lack of purchasing power further reduce the chances of viable project development."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"International donors are the primary form of financing renewables in Niger because domestic banks do not fund these projects. The EU and AFD have joined forces on two such undertakings, spending a combined 28.5 million euros ($33 million) on a 20MW solar plant at Gorou Banda and 32 million euros on a yet-to-be-developed 19MW solar-diesel plant in Agadez. Other finance to date has mainly targeted electrification efforts such as the World Bank’s $50 million National Solar Electricity Access Project (NESAP). Noteworthy funders in the off-grid space include the African Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the West African Development Bank and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Niger is unlikely to succeed in its aim to reach a 28% share of renewable energy in installed capacity by 2030, given that its current share is just 5% and the country offers little in the way of clean energy incentives. The government also aims to connect 30% of the population to off-grid renewables by 2030. In September 2017, an import duty exemption for renewable energy components was passed, although the list of exempted equipment is subject to regular review and is inconsistently applied. Since 2016, tenders for renewables projects have been issued and these specify that projects must ultimately be transferred to state utility Nigelec."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Demand has steadily increased in the past decade, with future demand likely driven by ongoing electrification. Alongside similar initiatives, the World Bank’s NESAP is expected to make considerable progress in the off-grid space, given that only 1% of the Nigerien rural population currently has access to power. The historically slow rate of progress in electrification and Niger’s ample solar resources provide ample opportunity for off-grid project development."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Niger’s power demand is predominantly met through energy imports from Nigeria, while the market is dominated by state utility Nigelec. The Electricity Act of 2016 opened up power generation to the private sector, with IPPs also being able to enter transmission and distribution if granted a concession. The only independent producer to date is Sonichar, which supplies the northern zone of Niger through a 32MW coal-fired power plant. Several solar projects are either under construction or remain in the pipeline, and investment in non-renewable generation is set to continue. After repeated delays, the 130MW hydroelectric Kandadji dam began construction in early 2019, with the 600MW Sakaldamna coal plant facing similar uncertainties."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Nigerien power prices are subsidized and remain stable in the long term, yet were adjusted in 2018 to enable better cost recovery. Prior to that, prices had only been adjusted once since 2012, when a social tariff was also introduced. Compared to its neighbors, Niger offers some of the lowest electricity tariffs, with the average retail electricity price standing at $129.77/MWh. Equally, retail fuel prices are subsidized and have remain unchanged since 2013."}]}
