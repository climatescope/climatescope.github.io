developers face multiple challenges in Madagascar. Not only is access to finance generally limited, but administrative processes and land acquisition pose further barriers to clean energy deployment. Furthermore, the insecure nature of the grid is likely to cause stability issues for larger projects. International technical assistance has therefore recommended that most PV developers in Madagascar include a battery in their project (as in the 2018 Scaling Solar tender) and finance their connection to the grid. Finally, the state utility Jirama is the sole offtaker on the main grid and is under considerable financial stress, which creates significant offtaker risk."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in Madagascar has so far been limited, with the main source of finance coming from international development institutions. French developer Green Yellow built the aforementioned 20MW PV plant, with support from the World Bank. In addition to development finance, domestic companies are joining force with international partners to develop projects. For example, Switzerland-based Meeco Group announced plans in mid-2019 to develop two 45-kilowatt solar installations in cooperation with Madagascan companies Groupe Filatex and Enelec. The AfDB has also made significant investment to improve the country’s electricity system."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Madagascar aims to reach 85% renewable generation by 2030, consisting of 75% hydro, 5% solar and 5% wind. In order to achieve this, the government plans to install around 100MW of new renewables between 2015 and 2030. A 20MW project commissioned in 2Q 2018, owned by Jirama, plus a tender for 25MW of solar with storage supported by the World Bank's Scaling Solar program, are the most tangible signs of progress toward this target. Energy project tenders are permitted in Madagascar under the 2017 Electricity Code. Further policies include a reduction in corporate income tax for renewable energy investments – equivalent to 50% of the country’s total investment so far in clean energy. Tariffs and import duties on solar PV equipment have also been reduced."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Madagascar is among the most difficult countries to do business with, according to the World Bank Ease of Doing Business report. The country ranked 161 out of 190 in 2020. The report cited difficulty in obtaining construction permits, registering a property and obtaining credit to finance a project. Madagascar’s tax structure is also complicated. These factors make it difficult to start a renewable energy project in the country. With electrification rates encompassing only one quarter of total inhabitants and less than one tenth of the rural population, Madagascar offers significant off-grid clean energy development opportunities, particularly given its ample solar resources. Putting in place the right policies to attract business into the country’s electricity sector could drive new investment."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"More than three-quarters of Madagascar’s installed capacity is powered by fossil fuels, with the remainder accounted for by small hydro and solar, at 2% of installed capacity. Renewable energy additions have stagnated in the past few years, compared to the growth rate of new thermal capacity. For more than a decade, the generation sector has been opened up to independent power producers and there is a clear intention to attract more private and international investment to the industry. Independent companies can also sell power through direct sales or within rural electrification concessions, although experience in this segment remains limited. The typical PPA guarantees a volume and number of run hours to the generator for up to 20 years."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Madagascan power prices are relatively high compared to the average electricity tariff in Sub-Saharan Africa. Residential prices are comparable to the regional average of $122/MWh, yet commercial and industrial tariffs are 1.5 to 2-fold more expensive than the Sub-Saharan African average, at $213.74/MWh and $257.33/MWh respectively. All tariff types have increased in the last decade, despite government support for social retail tariffs. The steady increase in diesel prices and correspondingly high costs associated with the country’s dependence on fossil-fired generation continue to aggravate the financial situation of state utility Jirama."}]}
