there are no specific barriers, Kyrgyzstan's government and energy market players have expressed little interest in expanding the country's energy mix behind hydro and thermal generation, despite moderate solar and wind resource potential. Unless more supportive policy develops around clean energy and the country faces a power deficit (meaning not everyone will have energy access), it would be very difficult for a private-sector player to come into the country and develop a clean-energy project."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Over 80% of Kyrgyzstan’s capacity mix comes from large and small hydro projects, and almost no new capacity has been built in recent years.  JSC Electric Power Plants oversees generation and owns and operates almost all of the country's existing power generation, with no private sector involvement to date. The country’s Forty Steps program calls for the construction of 11 additional small hydro projects with a capacity of 161MW by 2021. No further announcements on these projects have been made since 2017."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"In September 2017, the Kyrgyz government implemented a new program called “Forty Steps to a New Epoch” that calls for more hydro projects by 2021 and sets a target for renewables to make up 10% of the generation mix, though it doesn’t specify technologies or a target year. The program is expected to create incentives for the design, construction and operation of renewables projects, such as exemptions on import duties, expedited or removal of licensing processes, purchasing obligations from the state utility JSC National Grid and preferential feed-in tariffs. The country has no established precedent for building renewables, making these ambitions questionable."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Despite an aging power fleet and transmission and distribution grid, almost 100% of Kyrgyzstan's population has access to electricity and the country hasn't established any energy access targets. This is one reason the country has invested little in upgrading this infrastructure or diversifying its power mix, and has allocated minimal to no resources into grid expansion, mini-grids or solar home systems. A government program in 2018 to install PV systems in remote villages is the only residential solar initiative to date in the country, indicating there is little support for such technology at the government level."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Kyrgyzstan's power sector was privatized in 1999, disbanding the state energy company Kyrgyzenergo and unbundling generation, transmission and distribution. JSC Electric Power Plants oversees generation and owns and operates nearly all of the country's existing power generation, which is mostly hydro and hasn’t increased in recent years. No private players have entered the country's generation market, though it is technically privatized. JSC National Grid operates the transmission grid and is entirely independent of JSC Electric Power Plants. SeverElectro, VostokElectro, OshElectro and Jalal-AbadElectro are the four public distribution companies. There are also 21 private companies that operate portions of the distribution network around the country's capital, Bishkek. While the energy market is technically unbundled, government dominance leaves very little wiggle room for private players."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Kyrgyzstan’s residential, commercial and industrial electric tariffs, which are fixed, have remained stable since 2016, when they were increased under the country’s medium-term tariff policy (MTTP). An update to the MTTP in 2018 calls for a gradual increase in tariff prices again in 2022, as well as making them flexible and based on the time and period of consumption by the consumer. These increases are intended to improve the financial viability of the state-owned distribution and transmission companies, which suffer weak returns due to high electricity losses and periodic blackouts."}]}
