main barrier to further Uruguay clean energy development is the countryâ€™s lack of growth in demand for electricity. It has already deployed significant new wind and solar capacity relative to the size of its market leaving little room for additions. During periods of 2017, hydro and wind projects were forced to stop selling power due to over-capacity issues. This created a $59 million bill UTE was forced pay because under Uruguay law, clean energy plant operators get compensated for all of their output â€“ regardless of whether it gets put to use on the grid."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"From 2011-2018, Uruguay received $4.5 billion in clean energy investment from commercial and international development banks. In 2015, annual clean energy investment hit a high-water mark at $1.2 billion with over 90% directed to wind plants. Just three years later, in 2018, renewables investment fell to what was then a low of just $5 million. In 2019, however, BloombergNEF recorded no substantial new clean energy asset financing in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Uruguay has the highest rate of non-hydro clean energy penetration in Latin America and wind and solar met 32% of national power demand in 2019.  . The substantial presence of renewables reflects Uruguayâ€™s strong clean energy policy regime and its longstanding National Energy Plan, which mandated 15% renewables by 2015. The plan also required that 300MW of wind and 200MW of biomass be added to the national grid by the same year. The goal was achieved a year early and in 2015 the country had 857MW of wind and 425MW of biomass installed. After reaching the 2015 goal, Uruguay clean energy activity slowed and the country has commissioned almost no new wind or solar capacity in the last three years. As of year-end 2019, Uruguay had 1,524MW of wind and 231MW of solar online. The AdministraciÃ³n Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones ElÃ©ctricas (UTE) raised hopes that clean energy development could return to Uruguay when in 2019 it released rules related to a potential tender for 65MW of new PV capacity. The auction was later postponed, however and as of November 2020 had still not been held."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Uruguayâ€™s clean energy sector boomed 2011-2015. However, the spike in power generation from intermittent sources saturated the market. As a result, investment has declined and the country appears unlikely to hold major auctions again soon."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Uruguayâ€™s electricity market is overseen by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines. Vertically-integrated state-owned utility UTE controls parts of generation and all transmission and distribution. UTE allows the participation of independent power producers through auctions, usually through 20-year power purchase agreements (PPA)."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"As Uruguay is heavily dependent on hydropower, auctions have been a key mechanism to diversifying its power matrix. From 2009-2016, the country contracted over 300MW of wind through auctions. As a result, wind generation jumped from 144GWh in 2013 to 4,752GWh in 2019. Rising intermittent generation combined with flat overall demand has also, rather unfortunately, resulted in some curtailment issues in Uruguay. Power prices in Uruguay plunged in 2019 to their lowest levels in a decade, mainly due to abnormally high production from the countryâ€™s hydropower plants. Commercial electricity prices in 2019wereslumped 29% to $160/MWh, while industrial and residential prices dropped 18% and 8%, to $129/MWh and  $218/MWh, respectively.  The retail price plummeted a remarkable 81% to $7.58/MWh. System operator AdministraciÃ³n del Mercado ElÃ©ctrico del Uruguay (ADME) attributed the drops to high precipitation levels and strong hydropower generation, which pushed spot prices to near zero many weeks of the year."}]}
