strong local manufacturing capacity for wind and solar leaves little space for overseas players to compete. Many auctions only accept bids from companies with a significant track record in China. The government is opening up more segments of the energy sector – such as the distribution grid and electric vehicles – for domestic private and foreign investment. Even though the escalating tension with the U.S. looms large on growth, its impact on China’s wind and solar developments, batteries and electric vehicles has been limited so far. What remains a relevant question is whether the incumbent grid companies will allow competition in the liberalizing retail power market. They have opposed the ‘prosumer’ reforms since late 2017. New pilots announced in 2019 in 26 cities renew hope, though progress is still slow."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"China's decade long clean energy investment rally snapped in 2018, as major policy revamps slowed the speed of wind and solar installations. A transition period is underway currently to phase out government subsidies. State-owned companies have grown their dominance in China’s clean energy investments, with private investors narrowing exposure to a slowing market. China's clean energy investments are likely to stabilize, if not decline slightly, in the coming years on the back of stable new wind and solar installations, before subsidy-free economics and grid dispatch reforms boost further growth."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The world’s largest power market is undergoing a series of changes that will impact both generation and retail. For renewable energy, generous feed-in tariffs that were the norm for much of the past decade are coming to an end. Subsidy-free capacity – and competitive auctions to allocate the remaining subsidy – will drive new build in 2020, after which subsidies are likely to be completely eliminated. Retail liberalization now allows wind and solar assets to sell power directly to large-end users in half the country, albeit for a short duration of less than a year. A ‘prosumer’ (producer+consumer) reform is slowly moving ahead, which, once implemented, will allow distribution-grid-connected projects to serve neighboring loads. China’s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, made by President Xi Jinping on September 22, 2020 should accelerate the growth of clean energy capacity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"China's power demand grew 4.5% year-on-year in 2019, to 7,226TWh. Growth contracted by 1.3% in 1H 2020 due to Covid-19. Despite the blip, the energy transition and electrification of transport, heating, industrial processes, etc. are long-term policy goals that will continue to bolster demand. Investing in renewable energy will be subject to new rules for managing subsidy-free build as well as growing power price risks brought by market deregulation. Policymakers are mulling solutions to the estimated $66 billion current deficit in the funding pool for renewable energy subsidies. Asset owners’ balance sheets will benefit should they implement an effective solution."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal still dominates China’s power system, accounting for 52% of capacity and 62% of generation in 2019. Wind and solar together now account for 21% of capacity and almost 9% of generation. Generation from renewables continues to grow, not only due to growth in capacity, but also due to reduction in curtailment. China's grid companies have deployed multiple approaches to incorporate more renewables, including mandates for minimum dispatch hours, expanded inter-regional power transfer capacity and thermal generator flexibility retrofits. The result is historically low national average curtailment rates of below 3% for both wind and solar, despite the depressed power demand due to Covid-19. The share of wind and solar in overall power generation topped 11% in 1H 2020."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"China’s residential electricity prices are among the lowest in the world because the consumers are subsidized by commercial and industrial (C&I) users. It began to address this cross-subsidization in 2016, by lowering retail C&I power costs. China’s Premier Li Keqiang announced further C&I retail tariff discounts in 2020, to help restore the Covid-19 battered economy. Levelized costs of solar and wind power have dropped significantly on the back of efficiency improvements and rising supply. Auctions introduced since 2019 are putting additional pressure on costs. Wind and solar ‘subsidy-free’ projects – receiving only local coal power reference price – have been announced in two-thirds of the country."}]}
