state monopoly and weak enabling framework are barriers to clean energy project development.

Small biomass and biofuels investments dominated in the late-2000s, while the most significant deals to date were small hydro investments at the beginning of the decade, in addition to a large solar deal in 2019.

The 2015 Presidential Decree on renewable energy and the Energy Saving Programme foresee a modest target of 6-7% of installed clean energy capacity by 2020. The country will likely just fall short of this target, with 4% of renewable power capacity recorded in 2019. The country’s mechanism to advance clean energy build is via an annual quota system, which sets different technology thresholds. In 2019, the quota was for 15.9MW of wind power only. In 2020, the quota is for 6MW biogas, 19.8MW wind, 7MW hydro and 1.5MW wood fuel and other biomass. Small-scale industrial users can benefit from a ten-year feed-in tariff. Finally, Belarus offers custom duties and tax incentives to clean power projects that are considered official investment projects (i.e. the developers have signed an investment agreement with Belarus)."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"As a fully electrified country overseen by a state utility, immediate investment opportunities may be more challenging than in other emerging markets. However, there is potential to reduce dependency on imported gas and enhance energy security via renewables. Should the country apply to become a contracting party of the Energy Community, this could also bring stringent rules on further unbundling the power sector, which could open up new opportunities. Belarus scores well in the World Bank’s 2020 Ease of Doing Business report, ranked in place 49 out of 190."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The main source of power in Belarus is gas, accounting for 98% of power generation in 2019. Biomass, biogas and small hydro have been installed piecemeal in the past decade, but only made up 1% of installed capacity in 2019. Small- and utility-scale solar installations have been picking up since 2015, totaling around 150MW by 2019. There is around 100MW of onshore wind installed. The state utility Belenergo is vertically integrated and oversees all segments of the power sector. Rules have been relaxed slightly for power generation, so that IPPs have been able to enter the market. They can, however, only sell power to Belenergo, as bilateral contracts are currently not possible."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power tariffs are subsidized and are therefore some of the lowest for the region at around $94.45/MWh.
