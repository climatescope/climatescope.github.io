fragile security environment is an overarching barrier to project development. Additionally, the lack of incentivizing legal framework, finance and transparency further hinder the country’s attractiveness to investors. The grid is in need of improvement and expansion prior to adding significant new-build. This has slowed down the development of the Djermaya solar plant, for example. State utility SNE is unable to recover its costs due to the mandated price subsidies, but seems to have been able to meet its contractual obligations so far."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There are hardly any investments in clean energy in Chad. To date, all finance has come exclusively from outside the country and has been disbursed at concessional rates. There are less active financiers than in neighboring countries, with the main actors being the EU, the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank. After a delay of two years, the 60MW Djermaya Solar plant was the first utility-scale renewable energy project to be announced in Chad in 2018. The EU is backing the project with a 6.35 million-euro ($7.3 million) grant. Funding is scarce. Indeed, the difficulties in securing financing were partly behind the repeated delays that affected Vergnet’s 1.1MW wind farm at Amdjarass, which finally came online for initial testing in late-2017."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Chad has been slow to set up renewable energy incentives. As a first step, the government created the Agency for the Development of Renewable Energy (ADER) within the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, which is accountable for renewables-based electrification, among other responsibilities. The government has not set a national target regarding renewable energy deployment or passed any further major supporting policies. The exception is the 2020 finance law, whereby any equipment relevant to the generation and promotion of renewable energy is exempt from import duties and value-added tax."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electrification rates remain low in Chad, with only a tenth of the population having access to power. Urban access has been steadily improving, while rural rates linger around 2%. This contrasts with the government’s goal of a 53% national and 20% rural electrification rate by 2030. Microgrid projects are few and far between, but offer great potential, particularly given the large distances in the country. There are persistent concerns about the lack of investment in transmission and distribution, with grid congestion a particular issue for projects in and around the capital N’djamena."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Chad’s current generation fleet is exclusively powered by fossil fuels. Generation is open to private investment, with the 2019 energy law also opening up distribution. Transmission remains the state utility SNE’s prerogative, yet it may delegate management to private companies should it so wish. SNE remains the country’s offtaker, purchasing electricity from a 20MW thermal plant owned and operated by VPower, as well as the NRC 20MW thermal plant. Vergnet’s aforementioned wind plant does not seem to be generating power so far. A further IPP, Aggreko, entered the market in mid-2019 with a 24MW heavy fuel oil plant. A law setting out more detailed regulations for IPPs, which clarifies the procedures and penalties, remains stuck in the National Assembly."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Chad’s government subsidizes power retail tariffs, which have remained unchanged since their last adjustment in 2012. The government is committed to increasing the population’s access to cheap electricity, so there is little probability of rates rising in the short term. The tariffs are nonetheless higher than most neighboring countries, at an average retail power price of $166/MWh."}]}
