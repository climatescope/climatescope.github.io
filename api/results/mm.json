major barriers for clean energy development include policy uncertainty as well as political and offtaker risks. There are no feed-in tariffs to support renewable power. Projects are subject to non-transparent negotiation with the government. Many large-scale hydro projects become a source of conflict and are held back by local protests, and this might impact future development of large scale wind projects as well. As the market is not yet liberalized, it is not clear if the state owned grid companies are willing to keep to the terms of the power purchase agreements. The 2020 solar tender was a positive move, but it was announced suddenly and gave foreign players little time to prepare for the bid."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Myanmar's clean energy investment has been dominated by overseas concessional finance from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Besides, utilities from China, Europe and Southeast Asian countries are investing and developing renewable energy projects in Myanmar."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Myanmar’s National Electrification Plan targets 50% electrification by 2020 and 100% by 2030. The country appears to be on track to meet these goals. Electrification rate crossed 50% in January 2020 and was at 54% by June 2020. Electricity demand is rising fast as a result, but power plant construction is lagging behind. During the dry season, when hydropower output is low, the grid operator is forced to resort to rolling blackouts as a result. Myanmar aims to generate 8% of electricity through non-hydro renewable energy sources by 2021, and 12% by 2025. To that end, Myanmar announced its first-ever tender for solar power in May 2020. If all of the tendered 1.06GW of solar is built on time, Myanmar has a good chance of reaching its 2021 goal.  Controversies surrounded the tender. Developers had only one month to submit their bids, which would have been insufficient even without the challenge of Covid-19. Myanmar later extended the deadline by another month, but even that was not deemed enough by many developers. Latest news reports indicate that Chinese developers accounted for more than half of all bids. If more solar tenders are floated by 2023-24, Myanmar could meet its 2025 target too. All utility-scale solar is procured via tenders. There is no countrywide feed-in tariff program."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Myanmar's power demand is rising sharply, with the World Bank expecting an 11% annual increase to 2030. The country will need to increase its power capacity four-fold by 2030 from the 2017 level to meet its demand, partly arising from the target of 100% electrification. In addition to developing utility scale gas plants and renewables, the government has ambitious plan to build microgrid and offgrid projects across the country, with funding from multilateral development agencies."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Natural gas and large-scale hydro are two dominant sources of energy for Myanmar, accounting for over 90% of the country's installed capacity. Renewable energy is getting traction, with the country's first utility-scale solar plant of 40MW coming online in May 2019, and a tender for 1.06GW of solar completed in July 2020. Although the country's power market is still dominated by a few state owned players, it is starting to open up power generation to foreign players. Sembcorp Power, a Singaporean utility, became the first foreign independent power producer in Myanmar in 2019. Chinese players are very active in the market. Japan's Marubeni Corporation won a $2 billion tender to build a 1.25GW gas power plant in July 2020."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices were low and highly subsidized before July 2019, when they were raised to fund new grid investments. Prices rose by more than 60% for some commercial users. Industrial power tariffs were also increased. Residential rates remained the same for the smallest users (35 kyat/kWh), but rose sharply for those who use more than 30kWh per month. Even the highest residential rates remain well below those of neighboring Thailand. Residential users in India pay roughly three times more than the tariff in Myanmar."}]}
