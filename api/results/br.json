as result of economic and political instability, the Brazilian real has depreciated significantly, reaching a record low of 5.89 USD/BRL on May 12, 2020 and remaining generally above 5 USD/BRL since mid-March, down from an average of 4 USD/BRL in 2019. This has a detrimental impact on the cost of imported energy equipment and has significantly raised the capex of solar projects, while also hitting revenues of developers as power purchase agreements are in local currency."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Brazil attracted almost $58 billion in new asset finance for utility-scale clean energy plants in 2010-19, by far the largest in Latin America over the period. Wind alone accounts for 58% of the total, while utility-scale solar attracted 9%. Distributed PV attracted another $3.2 billion over 2016-19, with 2019 accounting for over 71% of this total. Brazilian national development bank BNDES has played a major role in the development of the country’s renewable energy market. The bank is the top global lender to clean energy, having disbursed almost $24 billion for renewable energy projects (excluding large hydro) between 2010 and 2019. However, the bank had changed the methodology it uses to calculate interest rates. Those are now slated to increase gradually for new loans through 2023 until they reach par with commercial levels. Between now and then, we expect BNDES’ contributions to fade somewhat as private capital takes a more prominent role."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Since 2009, Brazil has implemented reverse auctions to contract new clean energy generation capacity to supply the regulated utility market. The country pioneered competitive auctions, which has led to 30GW of renewable energy contracted to date. As a result of the Covid-19 crisis, on March 30, 2020, Brazil postponed two energy auctions previously scheduled for 2020. The government says it will reassess and announce new auction timelines after the crisis. Two auction rounds scheduled for 2021 remain unchanged. Sharp competition among project developers resulted in the lowest average solar auction price ever recorded in Brazil of $17.5/MWh in July 2019. Net metering has also become a widely utilized clean energy policy. Retail electricity customers may install up to 5MW self-generation facilities, connect to the grid, deliver surplus generation and obtain compensation in the form of a subsequent billing credit. The incentive has led to a distributed solar boom, with small-scale PV capacity jumping from around zero in 2015 to over 5GW (DC) by year-end 2020. However, the boom has prompted a rethink of regulation and retail tariff design and the country’s regulator, ANEEL, is reviewing net metering rules."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"After a deep recession in 2015-16, Covid-19 is pushing Brazil back into a new crisis. GDP expanded at just 1.1% per year in the period 2017-19 and the country’s economy is expected to shrink around 5% in 2020. Inflation in 2020 is expected to reach the lowest level of the decade at 3.1%, down from 3.7% in 2019. As result, Brazil’s benchmark Selic rate has seen steep drops, reaching a historic low of 2% in August 2020."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Brazil has the largest power market in Latin America, with total installed capacity of 171GW in 2019, up from 162GW in 2018. The country’s size, plentiful resources and conducive policies have made it the region’s main renewable energy market and one of the top 10 in the world. Its matrix remains highly reliant on hydropower, which accounted for roughly 64% of the country’s generation in 2019. The heavy reliance on one source came at a high cost in 2014: a prolonged drought caused significant stress for Brazil’s water supply and energy matrix, exposing the market to costly fossil-fuel generation. The crisis emphasized the country’s need for power sector diversification. Auctions and net metering will continue to be crucial policies to develop Brazil’s power sector. In terms of structure, the power market is fully unbundled and fairly evenly split between state-owned and private-sector players."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity prices jumped an average of 95% between 2010 and 2019 in local currency terms for commercial, industrial and residential consumers. This was mainly due to inflation and decreased hydropower generation. In 2019, Brazil’s retail tariffs were among the highest in Latin America, at $194/MWh for commercial, $165/MWh for industrial and $195/MWh for residential. Commercial and industrial (C&I) customers with power demand greater than 500kW are eligible to purchase electricity from Brazil’s deregulated wholesale market. Consumers with demand between 500kW and 2MW (special consumers) choosing this option must purchase wholesale power generated from incentivized renewable sources, including wind, small hydro, biomass and solar. The maximum threshold for special consumers will fall from 2MW to 1.5MW in January 2020 and decline by 0.5MW every January until 2023."}]}
