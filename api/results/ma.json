political stability and business-friendly legal frameworks have combined with its excellent solar and wind resources to fuel consistent speculation on its renewables ambitions. The local content requirement of the 850MW wind tender awarded in 2016 was met, whilst also setting a world record-low tariff. Completed in 2017, the Siemens-Gamesa blade factory in Morocco is the only facility of its kind in Africa. Located in free-export zone of the port-city of Tangier, it is envisioned that this factory will enable further cost reductions for local projects in Morocco, whilst opening up export markets in Africa. The Moroccan renewable-energy agency, Masen, has been instrumental in reducing both barriers and risk in Moroccan renewables investment. Masen has borne forex risk, performed environmental studies and land preparation, issued green bonds, acted as an offtaker, and blended concessional finance to consolidate loans with debt profiles suited to both developers and Masen. All of these functions have contributed to the success of the projects to date and have helped streamline renewables investment in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Moroccan solar tenders have stipulated storage requirements, in order to displace expensive generation from fuel oil currently used to meet Moroccoâ€™s high evening peak demand. Concessional finance from the World Bankâ€™s Clean Technology Fund (CTF) has been key in kick-starting the Moroccan solar thermal industry. CTF and CTF MDB (co-financing) have totaled $1.3 billion across the Noor I-III and Noor-Midelt projects. This financing has in turn attracted a further $3.3 billion from MDB and development banks. Developer finance and assumed equity make up the remaining $874 million of the Noor solar thermal projects as of 2018. In contrast, Moroccan wind projects have been successful in attracting significant amounts of commercial finance. Lured by Moroccoâ€™s world-class wind resource, commercial finance has provided some $894 million of the disclosed $1,762 million invested in the wind sector since 2011. Total investment in the Moroccan wind sector is expected to reach $3.7 billion by 2020."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Heavily dependent on fossil-fuel imports for its energy needs, Morocco has ambitious targets of 42% of its generating capacity to be renewable by 2020, and 52% by 2030. At the time these targets were announced in 2009, Morocco had only 280MW of wind capacity. By the end of 2019, renewable capacity had grown to 1,220MW of wind and 711MW of solar. Wind and solar will need to reach 2GW each by 2020 to meet the target. There is enough capacity in the pipeline for Morocco to meet its target, but most of these projects will not be commissioned until after 2020. The renewables sector is seen as key to securing energy independence, whilst reducing expensive fuel imports, and so has received strong state support. The first 400MW of hybrid solar thermal and PV of the Noor-Midelt projects was announced in 2018. The winning consortium, led by EDF, bid a price of $70/MWh, which includes five hours of storage for dispatch into the evening peak."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Moroccoâ€™s electricity demand has grown at an average rate of 5.1% since 2010, slightly outpacing average economic growth of 3.5%. Of particular importance to the energy sector, peak electrical demand has also grown at a similar rate to total demand. Morocco has had great success in the electrification of rural areas, with the ONEE connecting more than 99% of the Moroccan rural population to the grid by 2014. The law that provides the framework for renewables projects, law 13-09, only permits the sale of electricity over the medium- and high-voltage networks. In 2015, the publication of act 58-15 opened up the possibility of access to the low-voltage networks, seen as key to the growth of the small-scale PV sector. However, as of 2019, this act is not yet implemented and therefore any sale of electricity back to the grid by small enterprises or private individuals is not yet possible. The intention is for this obstacle to be removed in the short to medium term. Estimates of total wind-resource potential for Morocco are as high as 25GW."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal is the largest sector in Moroccoâ€™s power mix, accounting for 40% of capacity and more than 67% of generation as of 2019. The coal sector has added more than 2.4GW of capacity since 2011, with 1.3GW added in 2018. In the context of total capacity growth of 35%, renewables capacity has remained constant at around 34% for the last five years. Wind and solar capacity has more than tripled from 5% to 18% since 2011, and additions of a further 2GW of renewable capacity in the coming years will push this to the 2020 target of 42%. Recent years have been poor for hydroelectric generation, and total renewables generation has been flat at around 16% but grew to 20% in 2019. This has hidden an underlying growth in solar and wind generation from only 3% in 2010 to 16% in 2019. The Moroccan state utility, ONEE, still holds a monopoly over the transmission network and is involved in all sales of electricity in Morocco. ONEE also accounts for around a third of total generation, and more than half of the distribution and retail sectors of the power market."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Morocco are subsidized by the state utility, the Office Nationale de lâ€™Electricite et de lâ€™Eau potable (ONEE), which does not pass on the full cost of generation to consumers and therefore operates at a loss. Government support of the energy sector is a strain on public finances but has been rationalized within a developmental context. Servicing the 5% growth rate in electrical demand and the acute evening peak remains a primary concern in securing new generating capacity, much of this slack has been met with expensive diesel generators. The difficulty and expense in meeting evening peak demand has necessitated storage requirements for Moroccan solar tenders and electricity tariffs that are 40% higher during the evening for commercial and industrial clients. The high cost of meeting evening peaks justified a PPA for the Noor I solar thermal project of $189/kWh in 2013, which includes five hours of storage. Since 2013, a maturing domestic industry, technological advances and hybrid-plant design with PV have driven down costs. In 2018, the PPA for the latest solar thermal (hybrid) project was signed at only $70/MWh. In 2016, the PPA for 850MW of wind projects awarded to the Enel, Siemens, and Nareva consortium set a world record price of $30/MWh on average. PPAs for solar PV auctions to date are unknown, however, most projects have been commissioned in the context of rural electrification and deferment of grid upgrades."}]}
