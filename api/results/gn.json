to finance is consistently identified as the biggest issue holding back the implementation of renewable energy projects in Guinea. Moreover, the absence of clear off-grid regulations or clean energy incentives has much to do with the country’s reliance on large hydro, and subsequent disinterest in developing renewables. A lack of experienced personnel within the project development supply chain further increases the upfront costs facing potential developers. Prospective investors must also take import duties and VAT into account, given that exemptions cannot be assured."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"All energy investment to date has come from outside of Guinea due to the limitations of domestic finance. There have been no more than a few residential solar panels and mini-hydro plants installed, while capital has been directed instead into large hydro projects. The most notable investments to date are China Exim’s $1.3 billion package for the 450MW Souapiti dam, Sinohydro’s $812 million for the 294MW Kouokutamba dam and Sintram’s $400 million for the 100MW large hydro project. Further investments target electrification efforts, rebuilding the country’s distribution network and investments into four new interconnector lines. Despite the lack of non-hydro renewables to date, there is growing interest in investing into solar PV projects, and several MoUs have been signed with private sector actors."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Guinea offers no policies to incentivize clean energy development, partly as a result of its many rivers and the government focus on tapping into an estimated 6GW of hydropower potential. Promising developments include the creation of the rural electrification agency, AGER, in 2017. That was slow off the mark, however, with a board of directors only having been established in June 2019. State utility EDG’s mandate must also be more clearly defined. A long-awaited reform of the 1993 Electricity Law has now been drafted, although has yet to be validated. In an effort to restructure state utility EDG, Veolia has been managing the utility since 2015, with no definite end in sight."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has been steadily increasing in Guinea, with an average growth rate of 9.5% over the past three years. Electrification will continue to increased demand, with more than 60% of the population remaining unconnected despite a 22%-point increase in national electricity access rates since 2010. While urban electrification rates have been improving quickly, progress in raising the rural population’s access to power has been slow, with less than a fifth connected to the grid. There is therefore significant potential for off-grid project development given the county’s ample hydro and solar resources. Existing thermal plants have been modernized, and a program funded by the European Investment Bank is doing the same for the country’s large hydro assets."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Around two-thirds of generating capacity is derived from small and large hydropower, with the completion of the aforementioned Kaléta project in 2015 effectively quadrupling the country’s installed large hydro capacity. Hydropower capacity is set to scale up with a series of dams in the pipeline, including the 450MW Souapiti project. The remainder of Guinea’s electricity fleet is oil- and diesel-fired. There are plans to develop offshore gas fields, but reserves remain unproven. Efforts to liberalize the power market are driven by the prospect of trading competitively within the West African Power Pool and the first two of four planned interconnection lines should be completed by 2021. To date, generation is the only segment of the power market open to private players, with state utility EDG generating 90% of all electricity."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Guinea’s power prices are among the region’s lowest at an average retail price of $128.77/MWh, even given a significant price rise in 2018. Prices were increased in order to ensure a better cost recovery, with substantial increases to commercial and industrial rates. Prior to this, tariffs had not been adjusted for more than seven years. The state subsidizes the national utility EDG to allow it to remain operational. With regards power purchasing, EDG agreed to pay China Water and Electric around $85/MWh for energy produced by the 240MW Kaléta dam, which was completed in 2015. Investments in interconnectors aim to facilitate Guinea’s interest in becoming a net exporter in the mid-term."}]}
