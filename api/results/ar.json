Argentina has taken important steps to foster its clean energy industry, important barriers remain and the country has a long road ahead to achieve its renewable energy targets. Efforts to rebuild international investor confidence are a work in progress, as Argentina continues to navigate significant economic volatility. Argentina’s current crisis continues to hurt the ability of projects to obtain financing, especially those tied to the most recent auctions, RenovAr 2 and RenovAr MiniRen 3. Additionally, constrained transmission and distribution networks will inhibit new wind and solar build."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"A scarcity of capital, price-distorting subsidies and political risk combined to make Argentina an unappealing destination for clean energy investment in the first half of this decade. That began to change in December 2015 with the election of President Mauricio Macri. The Macri government sought to cut subsidies and liberalize energy markets to spur conventional and renewable project build underwritten with foreign capital. FODER, created under the administration, was backed by the World Bank, which provided guarantees of payment for the renewable tenders. The guarantees boosted confidence among foreign debt providers. Only then did Argentina begin to see financing for renewables, attracting over $6 billion since 2016 and peaking in 2018 at $2.5 billion, a record for the country. Recent progress notwithstanding, Argentina’s latest economic crisis has kept investors away and created severe difficulties for auction-winning projects that have yet to secure financing."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Argentina introduced incentives and targets for renewable energy in 2015, creating the Trust Fund for the Development of Renewable Energies (FODER) and providing tax incentives such as a VAT tax rebate and accelerated depreciation. Argentina also established a 2018 target to meet 8% of its power demand with clean sources. The target increases yearly: 12% by 2019, 16% by 2021, 18% by 2023 and 20% by 2025. Argentina did not meet its targets for 2018 and 2019 and currently meets around 9% of its demand with renewable energy."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Argentina’s clean energy investment has been severely affected by the country’s ongoing financial and economic crises. The financing of projects tied to the country’s third and final large-scale auction (RenovAr Round 2) remains at risk. Held in late 2017, RenovAr 2 awarded contracts to 1.8GW of wind and solar assets. The Ministry of Energy decreased considerably the amount of capacity tendered in 2019. Held in August 2019, RenovAr MiniRen 3 focused on small-scale projects and awarded only 259MW of clean energy projects due to transmission limitations. The country has seen a significant increase in corporate PPAs to procure clean energy as the renewable energy targets set in 2016 obligated large consumers to comply individually."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Argentina’s power matrix remains largely reliant on thermal and large hydro assets. Currently, 50% of installed capacity is gas power plants, with hydro representing 27%. The country has a considerable amount of oil and diesel in the mix at 10%. The share of renewables increased from 2.5% in 2017 to 7% through 2019 thanks to the commissioning of projects awarded in RenovAr. Total wind and solar capacity, less than 300MW in 2017, passed 2GW in 2019. For the first time, wind became the largest source of renewable generation. Despite the dramatic increase, Argentina still fell far short of its goal of 12% renewables in 2019. Around 6% of generation came from small hydro, wind, solar and biomass last year."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices spiked under the Macri administration as customer subsidies were cut. Since 2015, industrial prices have soared by 1,082%, while residential and commercial rates jumped by 1,074% and 973% respectively, through 2019. Market administrator CAMMESA regulates tariffs and is also the offtaker for the RenovAr auctions. Auction bids associated with large-scale projects dropped in each round, averaging $59.6/MWh in the first, $54/MWh in the second, and $42.4/MWh in the last round."}]}
