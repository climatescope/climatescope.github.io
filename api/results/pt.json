relative isolation from continental Europe means export opportunities only exist to neighboring Spain. Overcapacity and limited interconnection increase curtailment risk and may pose a barrier to higher market penetration of unsubsidized utility-scale PV. France, Spain and Portugal have signaled steady progress on interconnector developments between the Iberian Peninsula and the EU internal market, but it is unclear whether these projects will mitigate oversupply. According to Bloomberg's country risk assessment, Portugal has very low financial risk but scores less positively on economic and political risk compared to its European counterparts."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Portuguese wind investment has been limited: $270 million invested over 2015-18 was for repowering existing assets, while the bumper $300 million invested in 2018 was largely due to a pilot floating offshore wind project. Solar has reached grid parity in Iberia, and several large unsubsidized projects have made headway by striking long-term power purchase agreements. Some $330 million was invested in unsubsidized solar projects over 2017-18 (more than the entire 2012-16 period for PV). An auction held in August 2020 for the first time allowed solar-plus-storage projects to participate and awarded 670MW of capacity. The biggest investors in Portugal's new energy sector have been Banco Comercial Portugues, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentina and Caixa General de Despositos. Recent investment by these has been limited to refinancing wind portfolios, while more active investors in new-build renewables projects in Portugal in recent years have been CaixaBank, Banco Santander, and ING Groep."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Although the Portuguese government did not retroactively cut subsidies like neighboring Spain, it disincentivized renewables by suspending its feed-in tariff for large projects projects in 2012. The government is phasing out subsidies as contracts expire, but existing plants still receive feed-in tariffs. In 2017, the first feed-in tariffs expired and switched to market prices. Another large batch of contracts expired in 2020. In 2018 the government set up a task force to simplify approvals of new solar projects that receive no subsidized support from the state and sell on the spot market. After several years of stagnant growth in new solar capacity additions, the government in 2019 held the country's first utility-scale PV auction, which awarded 1.15GW of new capacity contracts at very low tariffs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Renewables have dominated new capacity additions in Portugal since 2000, but reduced government support since 2012 has led to some big players to leave the market. Enel Green Power sold its $1 billion portfolio of Portuguese renewable assets in 2016. Fears of retroactive cuts to the country's feed-in tariff program have not come to fruition; the government has said it would wait until contracts expire and for the scheme to phase out in order to guarantee stable returns on renewables investments. BloombergNEF forecasts that power demand in the Iberian Peninsula is likely to continue steadily on its growth trajectory through 2030."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Renewables enjoy a dominant share of capacity in Portugal, particularly onshore wind and hydro. Meanwhile, fossil fuels contribute just under half of generation. Onshore wind was the largest beneficiary of the feed-in tariff scheme, with capacity increasing tenfold between 2004 and 2014. However, the scheme's suspension ended growth. The government's support program for under-developed technologies has a maximum award of 5 million euros per developer â€“ too small for offshore wind projects. However, the government is helping to provide a grid connection for a floating offshore wind platform. Electricity generation and retail are fragmented in Portugal. Energias de Portugal (EDP) holds the greatest market share in both segments, but a number of players with a 1% share or less are active."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Portugal and Spain share the Iberian wholesale power market (Mibel), which is coupled with the European day-ahead market. Electricity is dispatched in merit order, and power prices are generally higher than the European average due to limited interconnection and dependency on imported commodities. Power prices are primarily driven by gas and to a lesser extent coal and carbon. Portugalâ€™s power price volatility is kept in check by a price floor and ceiling, which keeps the value of electricity between zero and 180 euros/MWh. This will have to change as the EU acts to remove all price constraints. The growth of wind, in combination with a large hydro fleet, has reduced the countryâ€™s dependence on gas. However, gas generation remains important as it fills the gap during low hydro or wind years."}]}
