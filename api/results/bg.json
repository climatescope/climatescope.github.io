in the renewables space remains fragile due to the retroactive policy intervention in 2012. The retroactive change of feed-in tariffs into feed-in premiums in 2015 had no significant impact on project revenue but added to the political uncertainty that has damaged investor confidence. Much domestic policy has focused on adding new small hydro capacity, but the country's ecosystem has already been damaged, and is unlikely to be able to support the volume of small hydro projects that have already received permits. Support for small-scale solar PV could restore some of the lost faith in the Bulgarian renewables sector."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment remained at low levels and reached approximately $125 million in 2019, with the majority going to a waste-to-energy plant in Sofia. Bulgaria has recorded no significant volume of clean energy asset finance since the government introduced retroactive cuts to renewables subsidies in 2012. This followed a small renewables boom during which solar attracted $3.3 billion in investment and onshore wind $2.5 million between 2008 and 2012. The government did not allocate any new budget for clean energy investment before 2020 as the country is ahead of its target, but has announced that small-scale solar (<30 kW) will be supported after July 2020. The electricity component of Bulgaria's 2030 renewables target was recently increased to 30% after the European Commission urged the country to raise its ambition. Increasing solar investments would help meet this target, given the country’s sunny weather."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Bulgaria reached 20.5% renewable energy in final energy consumption in 2018, overachieving on its 2020 target of 16%. The country aims to reach a 25% share of renewables by 2030, according to its National Energy and Climate Plan submitted to the EU. At the end of 2018, the share of renewables in its power sector reached 22% for electricity, 30% for heating and 8% for transport. The rapid progress made in the power sector saw renewables double their share in less than 10 years, due to a generous feed-in tariff that fuelled a solar investment boom. Unfortunately, Bulgaria's power sector suffered from a large deficit and government-enacted retroactive cuts to renewables subsidies in 2012 that have stunted the sector's growth. Bulgaria aims for solar growth until 2030 to be carried out largely based on market conditions, although small-scale solar systems of less than 30kW could start to receive feed-in-tariffs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Bulgaria has recorded almost 4% growth in every year between 2015-2019, with growth rates in excess of 6% in the years preceding the 2009 financial crisis. However, the country has also entered a phase where economic growth is not as energy-intensive and demand is expected to stay relatively flat in the future. Electricity consumption increased by 2% from 2018 to 2019. Construction of the 2GW new nuclear power plant facility at Belene will be a significant investment opportunity, and so far, four investors have expressed interested in acting as the strategic partner for the plant. Confidence in the renewables space remains shaken by the retroactive policy intervention rolled out in 2012."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Ageing coal power stations and a single nuclear power plant dominate Bulgaria’s energy mix, accounting for 42% and 38% of 2019 generation respectively. The operators of those plants, which are state-owned Bulgaria Energy Holdings for coal and Kozloduy for nuclear, hold a dominant position in the country’s power market. However, liberalization and unbundling reforms rolled out since 2010 have opened up the retail sector to competition. This has put pressure on retail prices and attracted international investors such as CEZ from Czechia or Energo-Pro. CEZ plans to divest its Bulgarian assets but sales have so far been blocked by anti-trust authorities. Bulgaria Energy Holdings remains the only entity that can sell electricity directly to customers at below-market prices and without going through the power exchange. The government is continuing to take slow steps toward the full liberalization of the power markets, with the support of the EU Commission and development banks."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Bulgaria is among the last countries in Europe to liberalize its power markets, with residential customers paying fixed tariffs and state-owned generators continuing to sell electricity on a regulated basis directly to some of the country’s largest consumers. Power market liberalization is in process, with the intention being that reforms could bring the sector's significant deficit under control. The wholesale power exchange went live in 2016, but sales volumes have remained below 25% of final electricity consumption. From October 2020, all non-residential customers are set to purchase their electricity through the free market. In early-2019, several state-owned generators directed more of their output to the grid in response to rising power prices. The government's decision to switch existing renewables and other regulated generation to a contract-for-difference remuneration system is also intended to increase liquidity in the market."}]}
