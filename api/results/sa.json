a lack of visibility on future auction rounds, the fact that competitive auctions are only to procure 30% of renewables capacity needed to achieve the 2030 renewables target is a concern. The remaining 70% is to be overseeing by the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabiaâ€™s sovereign wealth fund. Deals with PIF are to award tariffs based on recent auction bids, keeping procurement costs competitive. But relying on opaque, bilateral deals comes at the expense of the clear investment signals which are vital to helping a nascent renewables market achieve scale. Meanwhile, local content requirements - 17% for REPDO's Round 3 - have raised development costs while doing little to stimulate domestic manufacturing."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"After long remaining dormant, yearly new investment in renewables leapt to $400 million in 2018 and $600 million in 2019. That was largely the result of financial close being reached for the 300MW Sakaka PV plant and 400MW Dumat al-Jandal wind farm. Investment is expected to grow rapidly as projects auctioned through REPDO reach financial close over the years to come. Domestic renewables heavyweight ACWA Power dominates project ownership on a capacity basis with 210MW. A number of actors are present on the lender front, the ranking for which is topped by East Asian capital providers such as Sumitomo and Koreaâ€™s development bank. The Public Investment Fund â€“ the Saudi sovereign wealth fund â€“ is expected to play a leading role in backing future renewables projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Saudi Arabia upped its renewables targets in early 2019 â€“ the kingdom is now targeting 58.7GW of renewables capacity by 2030. The target is broken down into technology-specific chunks, the largest of which is 40GW of PV. It is unlikely that the government will meet an interim target of 27.3GW of renewables by 2023 â€“ the objective no longer features in official announcements. The countryâ€™s renewables sector has had a few false starts, but recent activity shows signs of progress. As of October 2020, some 3.4GW of solar and wind capacity have been auctioned through the countryâ€™s main auction program, REPDO. For its part, small-scale solar is likely to be buoyed by the publication of a new net-metering framework in July 2020."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Peak electricity demand has grown steadily, rising from 46GW to 62GW over 2010-19. Growth is likely to resume despite the economic impact of the pandemic. Besides the conversion of western oil plants to gas, policymakers are mulling the relative benefits of using domestic gas resources versus liquefied natural gas, terminals for which have yet to be built. In the long run, world-beating renewables resources are likely to undercut such investments. Moreover, the amount of power used by desalinification processes is likely to reduce as the country switches from existing thermal plants to installations employing reverse osmosis."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Gas generation plays an important role in the countryâ€™s east, while western regions rely on burning oil for power. Plans exist to convert western oil plants to gas, although progress in this area is lagging. Renewables additions have increased substantially in recent years from a low base â€“ capacity awarded through Rounds 2 and 3 of the REPDO auction program suggest that this will continue. However, investors could be deterred by a lack of visibility on future procurement schemes. The countryâ€™s partially unbundled power sector remains dominated by the state utility, and private-to-private power purchase agreements are not yet explicitly allowed. Contracts signed with renewables developers are take-or-pay, guaranteeing that power be purchased regardless of demand."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"As with other countries in the region, Saudi Arabia has seen record low bids over recent years. These include a $21.30/MWh bid LCOE in January 2019 for Dumat al-Jandal, the countryâ€™s first auctioned wind farm. Meanwhile, falling equipment costs, free land, zero connection costs and cheap labor have made PV the most competitive source of new bulk generation. Saudi Arabia is moreover committing to an ambitious subsidy-removal program, stripping away measures keeping down the price of natural gas and oil. Although it looks like subsidies for generation fuel will remain in place for now, retail power prices are being increased for all customer types. Such efforts are aligned with Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the economy from oil while increasing the role of the private sector."}]}
