lie ahead as the country works to clean its energy mix. Existing coal-fired plants have a low marginal cost of operation, and demand for additional capacity appears stagnant and easily satisfied by a few of the potential projects in the pipeline. Mongolia has no manufacturing capacity for solar or wind components. Imports of such equipment can be exempted from duties and VAT, based on their application and pre-clearance at customs. Foreign and private investment is welcome in the energy sector, but currency instability poses a risk given the tugrik’s history of depreciation. Policy instability, such as the upcoming revision of the renewable energy law and local administrative inefficiency, is also a potential investment barrier. Last but not least, Mongolia has four relatively independent grid regions, which adversely affect the wider dispatch/transmission of renewables output."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Mongolia could potentially produce 8,000 TWh of wind power per year and 5,000 TWh of solar power. However, renewable energy investment began late in Mongolia, and remained limited, amounting to just $200 million over 2010-16. Then, a new investment record was set in 2017, at nearly $100 million, with a mild slowdown again in 2018. Due to the nascent state of the renewables sector, the vast majority of investment has come from international development banks and foreign governments. The single largest investor is the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD), responsible for over a cumulative $120 million, and the largest local developer is Newcom Group. If the country is to meet its renewable energy target, it will need extra push for new investments in the coming years."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The government aims to reach 20% renewable energy generation share by 2023 and 30% by 2030 – a significant leap from the 2018 share of 7%. The most important legal foundation was laid by the Law on Renewable Energy (2007), as well as the National Renewable Energy Program (2005-2020) that provide official targets and incentives for global investors in the sector. The principal incentive is the relatively generous feed-in tariff  (FiT): the price paid under the power-purchase agreement (PPA) signed with the National Dispatching Center. In addition, such FiTs are denominated in dollars and paid in tugriks based on actual exchange rates, helping with mitigation of currency risk. Tax exemptions are also available for importing solar panels and wind turbines to Mongolia."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has increased gradually – a trend expected to continue in the coming decade. This is because GDP growth in Mongolia peaked at 17% in 2011 and has been slower since – it was as low as 1.2% in 2016. A rebound of GDP growth was observed in 2018 at 7.2% and 5.1% in 2019, meaning more potential for business in the country. In addition, national electrification is 88% (rural areas only 60%), so access to power has significant room to grow. The country has good land supply and weather conditions to build wind and solar, while mini- and off-grid systems operate decently in remote areas. Last but not least, it needs to modernize its coal-power fleet as it was built some 30 years ago."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels accounted for 93% of generation in 2018, although this may change as the high-polluting Soviet-funded coal plants age, and as renewables investment rises. Grid-connected generation capacity is expanding, which should reduce Mongolia’s reliance on electricity imports from Russia in the western grid and from China in its south (Mongolia has four grids). So far, almost 100% dispatch and purchase is secured for wind and solar. In addition, Mongolia has approximately 1MW of off-grid solar and 0.9MW of solar-wind hybrids, which typically supply  to Mongolian “towns” or soums and “living tents” or gers distributed in remote villages. The power market is generally state-owned and the grid is regulated, without near-term plans for liberalization. The state is the biggest player in both generation and distribution, and the National Dispatching Center is the only offtaker."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity tariffs in Mongolia range from 110.67 tugrik/kWh ($40/MWh) for households to 158.23 tugrik/kWh ($55/MWh) for commercial and industrial users. This level, having climbed 60% since 2011, puts the tariffs at a higher level than neighboring countries such as Kazakhstan, and just slightly cheaper than in China. Wholesale prices for general coal generators are at 80.86 tugrik/kWh, while the feed-in tariff ranges for on-grid renewables are: wind $80-95/MWh, small hydro $45-60/MWh, and solar $150-180/MWh. This level is generally more attractive than neighboring countries such as Kazakhstan and China. In general, energy costs are higher than in other countries due to transportation and limited know-how in the local market."}]}
