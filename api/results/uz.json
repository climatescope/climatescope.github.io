utility-scale clean energy projects have been developed in Uzbekistan to date, so it's difficult to gauge the development barriers that private-sector companies would face. Companies participating in the country's inaugural clean energy auctions should be conscious of challenges that will come with working with a utility integrating solar and wind power into the country's grid for the first time. A presidential decree in June 2018 listing components that are exempt from import duties doesn’t mention materials used for large-scale renewables. It’s unclear whether developers would need to pay import duties were they to develop a project in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Just 2%, or 215MW, of Uzbekistan’s power generation capacity comes from small hydro, the only operational renewable technology on the grid. Change is on the horizon, though: Masdar Clean Energy won the country’s first clean energy auction for a 100MW solar project, and Total Eren and Helios have negotiated contracts for 100MW and 40MW solar projects, respectively. A February 2021 auction  is expected to award two more 200MW solar projects, and a third auction will award 500MW of solar. The country also has soft plans to modernize 27 of its existing hydro facilities and build 35 more. All of these will lead to a fresh injection of clean energy investment in the coming years."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Uzbekistan has revamped its clean energy market in the past year. In May 2020, the Ministry of Energy announced a goal to source 25% of its power from renewables by 2030, which would require an estimated 5GW of solar and 3GW of wind. In partnership with the International Finance Corporation through its Scaling Solar initiative, the country rolled out its first clean energy auction in October 2019 for a 100MW solar project. It launched a second set of tenders for two 200MW PPAs in February 2020. The targets are ambitious, and using an established framework like Scaling Solar helps, but the country’s lack of history in developing renewables makes success uncertain."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Uzbekistan's electrification rate has remained at or close to 100% for many years, but is expected to decrease. In a concept note published in May 2020, the country’s Ministry of Energy is forecasting peak power demand to more than double, from 10.4GW in 2019 to 20.9GW in 2030. It anticipates it will need 29.2GW of power generating capacity to meet this demand, or 120.8TWh -- 176% greater than 2020 levels. As demand goes up, the country will need to upgrade its generation capacity to maintain this electrification rate. Utility-scale renewables projects appear to be the country's main priority for the time being, and there is no rural electrification program."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In May 2019, Uzbekistan's electricity grid and its national utility JSC Uzbekenergo were split into three independent joint-stock companies. JSC Thermal Power Plants manages and develops the country's coal, gas and large hydro projects, but the generation segment of Uzbekistan's power market is partially liberalized and private-sector players are free to build renewables projects. The country’s transmission and distribution segments are managed by JSC National Electric Networks and JSC Regional Electric Networks, respectively, and neither are privatized. Coal and gas make up most of the country’s current generation mix. Renewables are expected to make up a majority of future build, however, with a national goal of being 25% renewable by 2030."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"In July 2019, Uzbekistan’s Cabinet of Ministers announced it was raising residential electricity rates by 18%, to UZS 295,000/MWh ($29/MWh) and increasing commercial and industrial rates to UZS 450,000/MWh ($44/MWh). The move is intended to boost the profitability of newly formed distribution utility JSC Regional Electric Networks and grid operator JSC National Electric Networks. All grid-connected customers pay a fixed rate for electricity. According to the Ministry of Energy, until citizens can be provided with stable power 24 hours a day, a time-based tariff will not be offered for customers."}]}
