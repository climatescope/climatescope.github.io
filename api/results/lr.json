number of barriers are preventing clean energy from taking hold in Liberia. These include a lack of clear policy enablers, a financially-unstable utility and a regulatory commission that is still in the process of being set up. The distinct wet and dry seasons in Liberia also present challenges for planning and operating a system dependent on hydroelectric generation, which is increasingly difficult as the rainy season becomes less rainy with climate change."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The lack of a transparent and uniform policy framework has hindered clean energy investment in Liberia to date, but the country is focused on incentivizing private investment. Commercial lenders are yet to enter the market, leaving only concessional agencies to support the limited roll-out of rural electrification projects. Current projects are funded by NGOs and focused on extending grid access to the rural areas in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Liberia introduced energy targets in 2009 for 30% of electricity and 10% overall energy consumption to originate from renewable sources by 2030. This target is not overly ambitious given the country’s heavy reliance on hydropower and its large solar resource. The Rural and Renewable Energy Agency was established in 2015 and microgrid operators have since become active across several communities formerly without access to power. Draft policies and guidelines are being finalized in 2020 for independent power producers, microgrids, electricity licensing, and administration of electric sector."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The refurbishment of the Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant was a game-changer for the Liberian energy system. Power quality and reliability has since improved, and retail rates have dropped. However, demand for electricity far exceeds supply and significant grid investment is required. Outside of Monrovia, microgrid development has commenced despite the lack of a dedicated policy framework and regulatory oversight. There is significant potential for new solar and hydro projects, especially as the regulatory and policy framework continues to improve."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"LEC is a state-owned monopoly responsible for generation, transmission, distribution, retail and system operation in Liberia. The utility owns and operates a small fleet of mostly hydroelectric generators, including the 88MW Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant, which was returned to service in December 2016 after being offline for 26 years through civil turmoil and the ebola outbreak. LEC also procures power from independent producers – mostly embedded diesel generators. The LEC grid is concentrated around Monrovia and expansion of the grid to more rural areas is currently under way. Liberia receives 8MW of power from neighboring Cote d’Ivoire and will receive an additional 27MW once the West Africa Power Pool is complete."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Liberia’s retail electricity prices have declined significantly in recent years as a result of the refurbishment of Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant, which brought a low-cost supply to the heavily constrained power system. Substantial investment is required in the LEC grid, which may increase prices over time. Currently there are some citizens selling electricity outside of the regulated markets to their neighbors from diesel generators."}]}
