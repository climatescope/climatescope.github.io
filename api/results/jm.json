Corruption, crime and bureaucratic red tape all can boost the cost of doing business. That said, official barriers to development of renewables in Jamaica are relatively low. Consumers with rooftop PV systems may participate in the JPS net billing program and receive the JPS avoided-cost rate plus 15% for power delivered to the grid. As of year-end 2019, 803 customers with renewable energy self-generation were grid-connected, constituting 17MW capacity.

Wind power accounted for the highest share of that ($180 million), followed by solar with $127 million. Wind investment peaked in 2015 due to renewable energy auctions.

The country’s Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology has unveiled a 20-year Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) committing Jamaica to generating half its power from renewables by 2037 with at least 1,260MW of clean capacity .  The country has approximately 400MW of clean power under development, including 320MW of solar and wind plus 74MW of hydro, waste-to-energy or biomass. The government is expected to release details on how to respond to upcoming requests for proposals (RFP) in the first quarter of 2021. The last time Jamaica issued an RFP was in 2015.
