In addition, bureaucracy, and very slow processing of imports at the customs office, seriously inhibit trade."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There are effectively no clean energy investments in Turkmenistan to date, and the investment climate is not very conducive. Turkmenistanâ€™s policy of providing highly subsidized power limits commercial viability of renewable projects. Development finance institutions have been involved in strengthening the grid infrastructure."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Turkmenistan offers no clean energy policy. While its 2014 national strategy on climate change stated the intention to increase the share of renewables, there has been no concrete follow-up legislation on a target, nor has it defined quantifiable targets in its Nationally Determined Contribution. To date, the power market therefore nearly exclusively consists of gas plants in addition to a 1.2MW small hydro plant."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The country and its economy are effectively closed to the outside world.
