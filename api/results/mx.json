Mexico's energy reform has increased private participation in generation, the market remains highly concentrated in the hands of CFE, which controls approximately 54% of capacity. Efforts to strengthen state control under AMLO have raised questions around the durability of reform and undermined investor confidence in Mexico’s clean energy market. An extended legal conflict around the validity of recently introduced policies raises the prospect of projects being delayed or potentially put on hold permanently. Additionally, AMLO has indicated that he may eventually support constitutional changes that would unwind energy reforms. If enacted, this would likely mean removal of benefits that renewable projects enjoy, such as CELs, and efforts to limit new renewable projects via barriers to permitting and/or interconnection. Steps to increase the power of the CFE, expand its role in planning of the grid and give priority of dispatch of state power plants would also be expected. Regulatory and policy resistance is also expected to affect the near-term growth of behind-the-meter solar. The proposed, but as yet unsuccessful regulatory changes introduced in 2020 also imposed additional barriers on distributed generation. These include regional limits on projects, additional smart inverter standards and a requirement to complete comprehensive interconnection studies aimed at identifying grid upgrades that solar owners would be required to make. While adding costs, these regulations could ultimately allow more solar to be hosted on distribution grids."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Prior to the AMLO era, Mexico became a leading destination for clean energy investment due to a large increase in opportunities brought about by energy reform. Though efforts to strengthen state control at the expense of the private sector under AMLO have begun to deter investment, Mexico continues to see development activity. The second largest power market in Latin America, Mexico’s installed renewables capacity represents 15% of its 88GW total. This share is expected to grow with ongoing investment, which is continuing despite the cancellation of the country’s auctions. The country’s three auctions held over 2016-17 catalyzed investor interest in the country’s strong wind and solar resources, producing a step change in Mexico new clean energy investment from 2017 on, which has averaged nearly $5bn per year since then. Mexico’s financing landscape is diverse, with project developers, commercial banks and development banks all playing important roles. Both wind and solar projects have been successful in attracting investment. However, steps taken by the current administration have underscored its opposition to private investment in the power sector. Wind and solar, which are closely associated with market-opening energy reform and private investment, are all but absent from the CFE’s current portfolio and pipeline. Official plans for the CFE are focused instead on revamping its large hydro fleet and expanding its fossil fuel portfolio, primarily with gas plants."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Strong support for renewable energy is embedded in the reforms that have transformed Mexico’s energy sector. In 2012, Mexico established a mandate to generate 35% of power from clean sources by 2024. It authorized a Clean Energy Certificates (CEL) market in 2014. It also introduced a renewables mandate for power consumption, applying to all large consumers in the market including state-owned utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), that began at 5% in 2018 and rises to 13.9% in 2022. Progress on market reform and support for renewable energy have, however, stalled under current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO). AMLO has challenged energy reform and sought to block the growth of renewables with the aim of supporting the CFE. In his first two years in office AMLO has canceled Mexico’s highly successful renewables auction program, sought to dilute the CEL market, sidelined clean energy targets and eliminated legacy benefits that wind and solar plants received. Ominously, AMLO issued regulation in 2020 aimed at giving the country’s market operator expanded powers to block renewables from participating in the system, asserting that intermittent sources of generation pose a threat to the overall reliability of Mexico’s power grid. Implementation of these policies was successfully challenged under Mexican laws, but the government maintains its support for such measures, casting uncertainty over the country’s energy policymaking."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"After improving under the previous administration, business opportunities for renewable energy in Mexico have soured under the AMLO administration, which has proven hostile towards private investment in the energy sector. Since taking office in late 2018, AMLO has advanced a number of policies aimed at strengthening the CFE, generally at the expense of privately operated companies. Given that Mexico’s wind and solar industry is dominated by private firms, including business units or wholly owned subsidiaries of international utilities, this has been consistently bad for clean energy. AMLO has sought to dismantle the pro clean energy policy frameworks established by his predecessors. Since assuming the presidency, he has made it his explicit goal to revitalize public sector involvement in energy. Nevertheless, several fundamentals remain strong. Total generation has expanded by an average of 2.6% per year over the past five years. In June 2018, Mexico announced the end of the 15% customs duty on solar PV module imports, introduced in 2015, removing a barrier to renewables development. Mexico is also a potentially strong market for distributed generation. Though the market remains small, with just over 1GW of installed capacity, residential PV has continued to grow in recent years, driven by excellent solar resources, high electricity prices for high-consumption residential and commercial users and a national net metering scheme in place since 2010."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Mexico’s energy reform unbundled the state-owned, vertically integrated utility CFE, established the independent market operator and created a wholesale market. The CFE continues to hold the majority of generation assets and a monopoly on transmission and distribution. Deregulation of generation in 2016 created Mexico’s wholesale market, which has operated on a day-ahead basis since January 2016. Power in Mexico remains heavily weighted toward fossil fuels, with natural gas, oil and coal together accounting for 69% of total capacity and 80% of generation in 2019. Hydro accounted for 9% of generation and renewables met 8%. At year-end 2019, Mexico had nearly 6GW of wind capacity while rapid growth in solar has seen commissioned utility-scale PV capacity grow to 4.7GW. Policy changes introduced by the Ministry of Energy in 2020, and since suspended, sought to reverse a core achievement of prior reforms: a competitive, cost-based power market. The new regulations would have given priority to CFE power plants by endowing market operator Cenace with permanent authority to prioritize dispatch based on reliability rather than cost. The step would have ensured that zero marginal cost renewables do not undercut and eventually displace CFE plants, many of which are aging, thermal generators. Prioritizing these costly units would essentially mark a return to Mexico’s pre-reform power market. The ministry has said it will challenge the suspension of the policy in court."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Regulated power prices remained largely unchanged in 2019, and historically Mexican consumers have enjoyed among the lowest subsidized rates in the region. However, prices in Mexico’s wholesale market slumped, dropping to $70/MWh on average in the National Interconnected System (SIN) in 2019 from $83/MWh in 2018. Prices in early 2020 fell further, reaching their lowest monthly average ever in the first half of the year. Lower prices for natural gas and fuel oil, as well as growing natural gas imports from the U.S., have played an important role in lowering power prices. A growing contribution on the grid from renewables in meeting afternoon and evening demand has also had a dampening effect on prices. The contribution from wind and solar nearly doubled in 2019 from the prior year, providing 8% of monthly generation on average. Off-takers with a load center of at least 1MW are classified as “qualified users” and are allowed to purchase electricity directly from qualified suppliers. There are now 25 such qualified suppliers active in the wholesale market, including CFE Calificados, a subsidiary of CFE. CFE continues to be the supplier of basic retail services to residential customers and small and medium-sized commercial customers under regulated tariffs. Regulator CRE sets the final retail and last-resort supply tariffs based on the cost of energy and ancillary services required."}]}
