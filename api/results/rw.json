a landlocked country, importing components into Rwanda is an expensive endeavor, even if most pieces are exempt from value added tax. Access to local credit is a key challenge for off-grid companies, along with lack of purchasing power among the broader population. In addition, the Rwanda Energy Group (REG) said that it will not sign any new PPAs with developers, once the country’s estimated 86MW oversupply of generation capacity."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in clean energy in Rwanda has been volatile, despite consistent year-on-year growth in electrification. Most historical on-grid investment has been in hydro, natural gas and solar, but national utility Rwanda Energy Group (REG) has halted all permitting for future on-grid generation due to a current oversupply. Most future investment in Rwanda’s energy market is expected to go toward the expansion of the grid to manage this oversupply and to off-grid companies working with communities that will not have grid access in the near future. The financing matrix has been dominated by donor groups, most notably through a 200 million-euro loan from the European Union and the World Bank’s Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program. Since 2018, BloombergNEF has recorded no substantial new clean energy asset finance in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Rwanda’s 100% electrification target has been a key driver, and the country has shown unprecedented progress for Sub-Saharan Africa. By the end of 2018 – the last year for which there is complete data – the country had attained an electrification rate of 51%, compared to 10% in 2010. The national strategy aims to reach the 100% target via 52% on-grid connections and 48% off-grid solutions, such as solar home systems and mini-grids. REG, the national utility, says that currently 37% of households are connected to the national grid, while 14% access electricity is via off-grid solutions."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Rwanda prides itself on being one of the best markets to do business in among Sub-Saharan African countries and has an appetite for domestic and foreign investment to serve its fast-growing economy. The Rwanda Development Board has been created to support private sector players entering the country, complementing the strong presence of commercial and donor-backed lenders on the ground. Most of the growth in the energy space has been off-grid, as Rwanda has reached critical mass in its on-grid sector with an oversupply of generation. On the negative side, in 2018 Rwanda implemented new solar-equipment import standards overnight, which raised uncertainty for foreign investors and harmed the business model for some off-grid companies. Moreover, the country is reviewing its National Electrification Plan to divide off-grid areas between solar home systems and mini-grid systems."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Rwanda’s power mix is based heavily on hydro, at just under 47% as of December 2019, but other technologies, such as solar, natural gas and diesel, are also represented. Since 2010, the country saw installed capacity grow 180%, reaching 217MW in 2019. State-owned Energy Development Corp. has been the most prominent developer, but there are multiple private players involved in Rwanda’s generation sector. The country has an oversupply of on-grid generation, as well as a backlog of contracted projects. As a result, new developers will not be able to secure permitting until the roughly 200MW of generation projects with existing contracts are commissioned. The country is instead focusing near-term investment into transmission and distribution, both of which are fully controlled by REG."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Rwanda are among the highest in East Africa, and commercial and residential tariffs have increased considerably since 2010. The biggest driver of this is ‘take-or-pay’ contracts administered by REG. These contracts compensate developers for the contractual offtake from their projects even at times when power cannot be taken. On top of that, the PPAs are signed in dollars and are exposed to commodity- and currency-price fluctuations. As a result, retail electricity is highly subsidized by REG and the government of Rwanda. Small hydro remains the most popular source of generation, due to the strong network of rivers in Rwanda, and the country has taken advantage of methane from gaseous lakes in the southwest to generate electricity."}]}
