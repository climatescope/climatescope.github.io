heavily regulated power market and currency risks remain as barriers in doing business. Although the government bodies are working together to address these challenges and modernize the power system, progress has been limited. The concentration of support for utility-scale renewable energy projects also limits the opportunity for small-scale and behind-the-meter renewable resources."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Renewable energy capacity, excluding large hydro, has grown to 1,050MW in 2019 from just 135MW in 2010. More than 90% of the added capacity during this period came from utility-scale solar and onshore wind. Foreign institutions, notably the EBRD, have contributed to the majority of new renewable energy projects. Key priorities for the EBRD in Kazakhstan include supporting the countryâ€™s efforts in regulatory reform, addressing utility tariff setting and expanding renewable energy. Renewable energy auctions, held by Kazakhstan Electricity and Power Market Operator (Korem), have been the main driver for clean energy investments in the country since 2018. Currency risk associated with the Kazakhstani tengi, which depreciated 14% against the U.S. dollar in 2018, continues to be a challenge for renewable energy developers as well as for the bankability of the power purchase agreements in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Kazakhstan has a goal of generating 10% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030. The country initially offered feed-in tariffs to promote renewables development, but later migrated to an auction-based system under the coaching of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the International Renewable Energy Agency, and the United States Agency for International Development. The three institutions work closely with Kazakhstan to guide renewable energy policies and also provide financing for energy projects. While nearly 1,000MW of capacity was auctioned in 2018, the size shrunk to 255MW in 2019. Kazakhstanâ€™s ambitious renewable energy targets are inconsistent with the current policy that limits future tariff increases. Without passing on the additional cost of building renewable energy projects on to tariffs, funding the subsidies will remain a challenge."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity generation grew by over 30% between 2010 and 2019 fueled by a growing economy and population. Electricity is predominantly generated in the northern region by inefficient Soviet-era coal plants, while demand is greatest in the south, surrounding Almaty â€” the countryâ€™s largest city. The grid connecting the two regions does not extend westward to the oil producing regions adjacent the Caspian Sea. There is a potential for robust wind and solar development as the country aims to raise the share of renewable generation to 10% by 2030 from 3% today. The governmentâ€™s reversals of regulation and power market reform as well as currency risk associated with Kazakhstani tengi remain as challenges."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Power generated in Kazakhstan comes predominantly from Soviet-era plants that are old and inefficient and burn high ash coal of which the country has a 300-year supply.  As a result, fossil fuel generation account for nearly 90% of the power mix. Kazakhstanâ€™s abundant coal resource and well-developed transmission infrastructure have positioned the country as a net energy exporter in recent years. Despite the favorable policies to expand renewable energy, such as auctions and tax exemptions, Kazakhstanâ€™s heavily regulated retail tariff and the entrenchment of fossil fuel resources in terms of employment and infrastructure will likely slow the countryâ€™s energy transition."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Kazakhstan differ from region to region, and by the amount of electricity consumed. Average retail electricity price in the country is $0.04/kWh including distribution cost, value-added tax and other fees, due to government subsidies. In neighboring Russia and China, average prices are at $0.07/kWh and $0.08/kWh. Although recent auctions have helped bring down the cost of renewable energy in Kazakhstan, the average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for renewables is around 32 tenge ($0.083)/kWh more than double the average retail price in the country. Without restructuring retail power prices, bringing more renewables into the system will increasingly strain the resources of the Financial Settlement Company, which signs power purchase agreements with all renewable generators in Kazakhstan."}]}
