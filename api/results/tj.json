Although the government has called for the construction of small hydro plants and other sources of clean power, no renewables capacity aside from small hydro has come online. The Asian Development Bank approved a $10 million grant in 2013 to support green energy solutions in households, and Pamir Energy, a public-private partnership company, is investing in small hydro projects in rural parts of the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Tajikistan has little to offer in the way of clean energy policies. While no official renewables target exists, the government aims to have 103MW of small hydro installed by 2020 and, under the SE4All framework, is targeting 10% renewables generation by 2030.

Despite its strong market position, the utility is in poor financial health due to low subsidized tariffs, losses on transmission and distribution services, and mediocre collection rates. The government has granted Pamir Energy the authority to generate power, provide transmission and distribution infrastructure and sell to retail consumers in one remote region, but Barqi Tojik acts as the utility for over 95% of the country’s population. Industrial players consume most of Tajikistan’s power."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Tajikistan, like most former Soviet Union countries, has low power prices due to government subsidies. The 2019 average retail price stands at $43/MWh. The government has slightly adjusted rates in recent years in an effort to improve the financial health of its main energy company, Barqi Tojik, but not all tariffs have increased."}]}
