mid-2018, CEB was the single buyer and producer for Benin, which discouraged IPPs from having a role to play in the market. Furthermore, the transmission grid is limited, making the development of large-scale project renewable energy projects particularly challenging. The reforms as part of the 2020 Energy Law could help to incentivize more private players to enter the market."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Benin has not been able to secure much clean energy investment to date, with the most recent deal dating back to 2017. The MCA II plans to invest $375 million to modernize Benin’s electricity sector and the government of Benin will contribute an additional $28 million. No large-scale renewable project is yet present in Benin, but at least 75MW of solar PV is planned. In December 2017, the French Development Agency (AFD) financed the 25MW ’Defissol’ PV project, which is planned to come online by the end of 2020. On top of new solar developments, the program intends to restore the 500kW Yéripao Dam, and install a second turbine to increase production to 1MW."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The government of Benin is opening up the country’s electricity sector to private investors in a bid to increase supply and competition. This is being achieved by way of legislative reforms and clean energy policies. The 2020 Energy Law opened generation, transmission, distribution and retail up to private investment. It also created priority grid access for renewable energy producers, although this was limited to 50% of the authorized capacity. 2019 also saw a first competitive tender for 50MW of PV projects. These will be developed under the build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) model and will sell power to the country’s state-owned utility Société Beninoise d’Énergie Electrique (SBEE) under a 20-year PPA. In addition, the 2020 Energy Law widened the range of tax exemptions for renewable energy equipment."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Benin has significant off-grid electrification potential, with only 34% percent of the national population currently having access to power. Urban and rural electrification rates have improved in recent years, although only two-thirds of citizens in towns and a mere 16% of the rural population have access to power. Peak demand has been rising steadily in recent years."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Benin relies on thermal generation and has a heavy dependence on neighboring countries. In March 2019, the 120MW Maria Gleta II Heavy Fuel Oil and Gas plant began operating, and the country still has virtually no renewable energy projects to date aside from a 500-kilowatt hydro project. The planned PV projects should help Benin to reduce its energy dependence by improving local energy capacity. Finally, the country also plans additional electricity transmission interconnections within the regional market. So far, the grid has mostly served the south of the country, whereas the northern part of Benin is relatively isolated and has limited access to cost-efficient sources of energy."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"In previous years, the Government of Benin has contracted expensive thermal power generation to address outages, due to the unavailability of power imports arising from temporary supply challenges in Ghana and Nigeria. Power tariffs are regulated and have remained unchanged for many years, currently standing at an average of $151/MWh. The expensive generation mix and inability to cover costs has led the country’s distribution utility SBEE into financial distress."}]}
