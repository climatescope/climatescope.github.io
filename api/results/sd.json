entering the Sudanese market face a number of obstacles â€“ primarily the unstable macroeconomic and security situation. In addition to high capex costs due to country risk, the lack of market transparency, very low power tariffs and weak purchasing power pose further challenges to project development. The devolution of grid extensions to regional authorities impedes long-term planning, particularly given their lack of financial means to successfully plan and execute such projects. There is little visibility on future transmission projects, so many are being completed in a haphazard manner."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Developers face many difficulties in securing finance in Sudan. There are no domestic banks which offer loans to developers investing in clean power, and years of international isolation, coupled with crippling debts and a dire security situation, have left international financial institutions reluctant to bankroll renewable energy projects. Difficulties in attracting donors has therefore translated into a lack of utility-scale renewables build. Several projects have been announced, including 250MW of solar PV and four utility-scale wind farms totalling 320MW, but all have struggled to secure funding and have therefore been cancelled or downsized. Investments have been limited to rural electrification schemes, with the United Nations Development Program and the government implementing separate initiatives to expand energy access through distributed renewables."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Sudan does not yet offer any clean energy incentives. A public-private partnership (PPP) law, renewable energy act and import-duty exemptions for solar components have been in the planning for some time, but are stuck at various stages along the legislative pipeline. Furthermore, the 2001 Electricity Law is due to be overhauled, but little progress has been made to date. Aside from Sudanâ€™s plan for renewables to account for 20% of generation by 2030 as part of its nationally determined contribution, the government has not explicitly issued any further national objectives. With no utility-scale renewables commissioned to date, Sudan still has far to go in its deployment of clean energy."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Optimism abounded following the removal of the majority of U.S. sanctions in October 2017, but Sudanâ€™s economic situation has improved little since then. Inflation has surged, widening the chasm between production costs and rock-bottom power prices, and economic hardship will persist in the wake of a sharp ongoing currency devaluation. The reliance on costly imported fuel underlines the attractiveness of renewables, to which Sudanâ€™s geography is well suited, with its high solar irradiation and strong winds. Power demand has increased by 9% per year on average since 2015, but 32% of the national population remain without access to power."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The structure of Sudanâ€™s power sector has evolved in recent years. Following the unbundling of the sector at the turn of the millennium, 2016 saw the creation of the Sudanese Electricity Holding Co. This has an effective monopoly on procurement, with the holding company overseeing two generation utilities â€“ the Sudanese Thermal Power Generating company and its hydro-focused counterpart â€“ as well as two companies whose respective remits cover distribution and transmission. These companies remain state-owned, despite the 2001 Electricity Law to open up private participation in the energy sector. There are no real independent power producers to date, although there is one company that owns and operates thermal plants in a handful of regional capitals, although the fuel is supplied through the Sudanese Electricity Holding Co. free of charge. In terms of technology, the country is still predominantly dependent on oil- and hydro-based power generation, with hydropower accounting for more than half of installed capacity."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Sudanese consumers benefit from generous electricity subsidies, which result in some of the world's lowest retail prices at an average $21.24/MWh. A reduced â€˜social tariffâ€™ benefits those who consume less than 200kWh/month, which is a higher threshold than found elsewhere in the region. These tariffs fall far short of meeting utility production costs, leaving the companies financially dependent on the government. The option of increasing tariffs is politically difficult given the countryâ€™s political instability. Following the breakaway of South Sudan in 2011, Sudan lost the majority of its oil assets, leaving it with little choice but to import the fuel needed for its thermal power generation. Sudanâ€™s runaway inflation and currency devaluation compounds the challenge, making fossil fuel imports increasingly costly."}]}
