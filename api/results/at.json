shift toward auctions is under way, but the exact timing of the transition is unclear. Investors have little visibility on how the framework will ultimately work, adding to the uncertainty. The country has avoided retroactive renewables subsidy cuts seen in several European markets, but remains one of Europe’s slowest-growing markets for clean power. This is partly due to a nationwide trend – Austria has struggled to attract international capital flows, despite sporting a stable, specialized economy. Moreover, the country provides a robust framework for private investors, but setting up a company remains an onerous process. As in many EU countries, VAT rates and import duties are not reduced for renewables equipment."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Yearly investment in renewables fell to $0.3 billion in 2019, in tandem with technology costs, as new installations continued. Recent years have seen solar’s share grow substantially relative to onshore wind. Publicly owned players are the foremost project owners in terms of renewables capacity, with Land Burgenland and Verbund topping the ranking. By far the largest credit provider is the European Investment Bank, which has committed over $1.1 billion in clean energy projects as of the second quarter of 2020. The EIB is followed by Italian financial group UniCredit, and then a host of smaller domestic lenders."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Austria wants to achieve climate neutrality by 2040. It is on track to surpass a target of achieving a 34% share for renewables in final energy consumption by 2030, including large hydro. The country is also aiming to have renewables meet 100% of electricity consumption and half of final energy consumption by 2030. The government is also aiming to install 1 million rooftop PV systems by 2030. Renewables are supported through feed-in tariffs and upfront capital grants, although the government is drafting a new energy law to transition to a premium-based auction system. Originally due by 2021, the final law is likely to be somewhat delayed."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Demand is rising gradually, but growth is unlikely to accelerate in the absence of widespread electrification across the heating, industry and transport sectors, a longer-term prospect. The country’s power fleet is well maintained, and no phase-out looms over the coming years. A turning point was reached in April 2020, when the last of the country’s coal plants was shuttered. In the more distant future, the closure of the country’s 4GW of gas generation may be on the cards, if the country is to achieve climate neutrality by 2040. The country is not particularly well endowed when it comes to wind speeds or irradiation levels."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Various hydroelectric technologies provides the bulk of generation and flexibility services – pumped, small and large hydro installations represent over half of a total 25GW of installed capacity in 2019. The country’s installed capacity has decreased in recent years. However, renewables – mainly rooftop PV and onshore wind – have grown from a low base over the last decade to reach over 4.5GW. The power sector has been partly unbundled and liberalized, but the state retains a central role: majority state-owned Verbund owns the sole transmission system operator and dominates the generation market, operating 46% of capacity as of August 2019. Corporate power purchase agreements have yet to take off, part of which is due to the ready availability of cheap hydropower."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Wholesale power prices are lower than in most of Austria’s neighbors. That is in large part due to an abundance of large hydro generation. Cheap, low-emission hydroelectric power has long reduced the impetus to invest in other renewables, although this is changing as renewables costs continue to fall. Meanwhile, the country’s low-carbon power fleet has largely been shielded from the rising EU carbon price. Retail power prices have dropped for industrial customers but risen for residential users over 2010-19."}]}
