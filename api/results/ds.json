major obstacle to clean energy development and foreign investment in South Sudan is the ongoing fragile security situation. Moreover, the lack of an adequate transmission and distribution grid poses a serious barrier to both clean energy development and wider electrification. In addition to the security and political risks, there is significant currency risk due to the instable South Sudanese Pound. Adoption rates will remain low due to the little policy or financial means in place to support the deployment of clean energy."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The growth rate of clean energy investments has been non-existent in recent years, with most funding directed to electrification projects by international aid organizations and foreign governments. Only 1% of the national population currently has access to electricity. The lack of transmission and distribution infrastructure further impedes any growth in clean energy investment. In contrast to the minimal installed capacity to date, there is a pipeline of large-scale energy infrastructure projects, most notably 2.1GW of large hydro. Yet many of these projects lack financiers."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"South Sudan does not offer any specific clean energy incentives, nor has it submitted a Nationally Determined Contribution in the framework of the Paris Agreement. The country lacks a clear energy policy altogether, with the only relevant previous piece of legislation being the 2011 'South Sudan Strategic Development Plan'. This sets out electrification targets and was in force until 2016, but a new official plan has yet to succeed it. The country’s ongoing fragile security situation and unrest has diverted governmental focus away from clean energy deployment."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in the country is growing and expected to increase. This is due to the combination of population growth, very low electrification rates and little installed capacity to date. Taking into account the abundant solar resources, the case for off-grid solar development is particularly strong. On-grid growth is, however, limited by a lack of transmission and distribution infrastructure. The fragile economic and security situation in South Sudan will also continue to make it hard to attract utility-scale clean energy developers."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels dominate on-grid energy generation in South Sudan, with power plants consisting of a mix of oil or diesel-fueled facilities, with the exception of one small hydro facility in the capital, Juba. As much as 99% of the population is off-grid and relies on diesel generators for power. In terms of renewable energy, 15MW of distributed off-grid solar PV is progressively coming online, developed by Depo Energy. In 2019, there were some very small-scale solar-plus-storage projects from developers such as Equator Energy, Solar23 or Aptech Africa that came online. To support power market development, there are plans to create new transmission lines to Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The South Sudanese government subsidizes power prices for the few customers with access to the grid in the Capital, Juba, and charges one uniform tariff. The population has very little purchasing power, but the main issue is not the lack of demand, but rather a lack of installed capacity. Moreover, the national grid is often not operational. A handful of regional cities use heavy fuel oil-powered mini-grids, run either by the state utility or by local cooperatives. In contrast to those run by the state-owned utility, the grids run by the local cooperatives charge cost-reflective tariffs, which restricts customer numbers somewhat."}]}
