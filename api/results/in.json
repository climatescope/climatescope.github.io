is slowly increasing local content requirements for some solar projects to encourage domestic manufacturing. This is to replicate the country’s success in becoming an export hub for wind. Renewable projects can have 100% foreign investment without prior government approval. This has attracted top sovereign funds, venture capital/private equity investors, foreign utilities and oil companies to the market. Some projects have faced delays because of difficulties in land acquisition and grid connectivity. The government plans to alleviate this by creating renewable energy parks. The proposed reforms of electricity distribution companies should also reduce the large quantum of overdue payments to power generators."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"New clean energy investment in India totaled $10.5 billion in 2019, which was 11% lower than 2018 as the costs of renewable energy projects declined. Solar continues to attract over 50% of the investments. India’s ambitious clean energy targets, stable policies and the favorable economics of renewables draws domestic and foreign capital. The investors in India’s clean energy sector are diverse – including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, domestic power producers, oil majors, domestic conglomerates, private equity firms, development finance institutions and foreign utilities. Power producers are now looking to unlock equity invested in operational projects by bringing partners into joint ventures and setting up investment infrastructure trusts."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"India has an ambitious target of 175GW of installed renewables capacity by 2022. Even though it may fall short, the country will exceed its Paris Climate Agreement target of 40% non-fossil fuel installed capacity by 2030. Auctions have become the primary mechanism for growth of renewables. India was the world’s largest renewables auction market, by cumulative capacity awarded till the end of 2019. Other incentives are also in place – accelerated depreciation, waiver on transmission charges and net metering for rooftop PV. Renewable energy policies have generally been stable but the government has had to balance competing objectives of achieving low tariffs, localization of the value chain and increasing the share of renewables."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"India’s annual power demand grew by 50% from 2010 to 2019, and it is now the world’s third-largest power consumer, behind China and the U.S. At the same time, the supply deficit narrowed from 79TWh in 2010 to 6TWh in 2019. This was the result of rapid expansion of generation capacity as well as fast rollout of transmission and distribution infrastructure. The Central Electricity Authority expects electricity use to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6% for the next 10 years. This will be driven by population growth, the government’s focus on ensuring 24x7 power for all, economic growth and the electrification of sectors such as transport."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal remains the dominant fuel for electricity generation, with a 70% share in 2019. However, renewables have overtaken coal in terms of new capacity built each year since 2017. Renewables have benefited from supportive policies such as priority dispatch and waiver on transmission charges. Commercial and industrial users have also recognized the economic advantage of procuring renewables and are doing it through captive plants and power purchase agreements or PPAs. Power market reforms are in the pipeline, with a focus on improving financial and operational performance of the electricity distribution companies."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Average retail electricity prices rose by 1.5% in the financial year starting April 2019, compared to a 2.7% rise in the previous year. Commercial and industrial consumers continue to subsidize agricultural and residential users. The government is attempting to lower the high prices paid by industries by cutting down on the cross-subsidy charges. On a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis, solar and onshore wind are the cheapest technologies for bulk power generation since 2018. India has the second-lowest LCOE in the world for solar and third-lowest for onshore wind. By 2023, onshore wind combined with battery storage will have a lower LCOE than new coal plants. The corresponding cross-over for solar with storage could happen in the late 2020s."}]}
