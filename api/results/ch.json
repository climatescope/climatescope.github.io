Almost $4 billion has been provided to renewable energy projects in the country between 2014 and 2020. IWB Industrielle Werke Basel is by far the biggest lender to projects, at almost $10 million.

Switzerland provides feed-in premiums for renewables, which is financed by a special fund raised through a consumer surcharge of up to 23 Swiss francs ($25)/MWh. Historically, this program has mostly been used for solar project support. The Swiss Energy Act includes the target of adding 5,400GWh of additional renewable electricity on an annual basis by 2030 compared to 2000. Some 2,000 of the aforementioned 5,400GWh are to come from hydropower.

The shift away from nuclear, which makes up a third of total generation, will create a substantial gap in the mix, although the transition will not happen immediately. In 2017, voters rejected a scenario that would have had three of the country's five nuclear power plants close from 2017-2018. Instead, the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate will determine how long the plants can operate safely and no new plants may be built."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Industrial and residential electricity prices increased between 2018 and 2019, by 3% and 1% respectively in Switzerland.
