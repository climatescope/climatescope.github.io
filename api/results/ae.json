has been mentioned, state-owned utilities dominate the power sector – there is little sign that this will change. State utilities have single-buyer status, so private-to-private power deals are largely off the cards. Dubai’s net-metering program presents the only real option for corporate players interested in procuring on-site renewables from a private third party. The initiative has been restricted in May 2020 as the maximum system capacity was capped at 2MW, a response to a host of large systems being applied for by hotels and manufacturers. Yet, by and large, policy has been but stable and risks relating to the offtaker, currency and land negligible."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"As in most of the region’s leading renewables markets, clean energy investment has varied considerably from year to year. New investment in renewables reached a record of $4.6 billion in 2019, and nearly all clean energy capital flows serve to finance solar projects. Local banks are playing an increasingly active role, notably by backing installations supported by Dubai’s net-metering program. Meanwhile, the consortia backing the country’s large-scale solar plants have drawn from a diverse capital pool. Credit providers range from local players like First Abu Dhabi Bank and the Mubadala Investment Company, to international lenders of the likes of Natixis and Mistubishi UFJ."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The United Arab Emirates’ flagship renewables target aims to achieve an electricity generation mix composed of 44% renewables, 38% gas, 12% “clean” coal and 6% nuclear. A federal target for a 24% renewables share by 2021 looms in the more immediate term – this is unlikely to be met. Meanwhile, the UAE’s federal structure affords emirates considerable autonomy in implementing their own renewables targets, incentives and procurement schemes. Abu Dhabi and Dubai have had considerable success in running large-scale, competitive auctions to procure solar power. However, success has been varied in certain areas. Abu Dhabi has, for instance, struggled to replicate the success of Dubai’s net-metering scheme even as it has proven its ability to pull off large-scale renewables auctions."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has risen rapidly in recent decades, growing by nearly 10GW over 2010-19 to reach 25GW. The long-term impact of Covid-19 on demand will hinge on whether fears of a pandemic-induced expat exodus are borne out – foreign workers account for some 90% of the population. Regardless, favorable geography likely see more solar additions in the year to come, although there is a lack of visibility on tenders going forward. Yet much of the power fleet is relatively young. A high number of power purchase agreements for combined-cycle gas plants will come to an end in 2030 – many could be extended. Meanwhile, a transition toward less power-hungry reverse osmosis plants will contribute to decoupling the water and electricity sectors."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The UAE’s grid is fragmented among the various emirates, but gas remains the dominant form of power generation across the board. Representing 6% of installed capacity in 2019, renewables penetration is only just starting to ramp up. In the absence of a wholesale market, developers sell their power through take-or-pay contracts – their output is purchased regardless of demand. Independent power producers account for the majority of commissioned capacity, although the publicly owned utilities participate retain a major equity share in all projects. For its part, Abu Dhabi’s state utility – which is also active in the northern emirates – has been unbundled, although Dubai’s remains vertically integrated. Both retain single-buyer status, while generation is the only sector open to private participation."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Developers of solar utility-scale projects benefit from excellent irradiation levels, economies of scale and low development costs. Yet rock-bottom auction prices are also made possible by implicit subsidies, such as the fact that developers need pay for neither land nor a grid connection. Headline-grabbing bids have resulted, including a near-world record of $16.90/MWh recorded for Dubai’s latest solar auction in November 2019. Moreover, state utilities retain majority stakes in all utility-scale projects, reducing the cost of debt. Renewables are increasingly able to undercut fossil-fuel generators, for which fuel subsidies were removed in 2015. However, fossil-fuel generators continue to receive indirect support in the form of subsidized retail tariffs. For instance, residential prices have remained unchanged in Dubai over much of the last decade."}]}
