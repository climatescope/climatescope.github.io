constraints can complicate site acquisition for ground-mounted projects. Moreover, developers often struggle to navigate the various regulatory differences engendered by Belgiumâ€™s federal structure. This complicates the task of accessing region-specific support mechanisms, or gauging national renewables ambition given fragmented target-setting. Yet once identified, available subsidy mechanisms are reported to be efficient. An exemption might be raised regarding the scheme governing green certificates, the trading of which was curtailed after oversupply led to plummeting prices over recent years. Meanwhile, import duties and VAT rates are not reduced for clean power equipment."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in Belgian renewables has varied over recent years â€“ yearly investment has fluctuated from under $1 billion to $3.2 billion since 2016. This is largely caused by large jumps in offshore wind investment, with the amount going into funding PV remaining largely constant year-on-year. Belgiumâ€™s acquisitions market is particularly dynamic, attracting nearly twice as much funding as new build over 2019 through to the second quarter of 2020. Historic players such as Engie and EDF own the largest chunks of renewables capacity. Meanwhile, a range of international lenders provide credit, diversified across Belgium, France, Germany the Netherlands and Japan. However, topping the ranking is the European Investment Bank, which has invested a total of $2.3 billion in the Belgian clean power sector."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Belgian energy policy is set at a federal and regional level. National targets include a 17.5% renewables share of final energy consumption and 40% of electricity, both by 2030. Insofar as specific renewables, Belgium is targeting 4GW of offshore wind by 2030. The regions â€“ Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels â€“ have their own targets for technology and renewables share of consumption. Renewables are procured through green certificates issued for the production of renewable power. These are then purchased by obligated retailers before being bought by the transmission system operator. Moreover, Flandersâ€™ net-metering scheme is Belgiumâ€™s most successful â€“ it is due to be replaced by new grant-based incentives for self-consumption by 2021."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"As in most of Western Europe, a pick up in stagnant demand in the long term will hinge on the extent to which transport, industry and heat are electrified. That said, replacing the nuclear reactor fleet clears the way for new investments in generation assets â€“ during the latest power crisis, the government was reportedly considering procuring emergency electricity from Turkish power barges. Continued growth of residential solar is expected, while space constraints and acceptance issues could hinder growth in utility-scale onshore wind and PV. Cumulative offshore wind additions are expected to reach 4.1GW by 2030, from 1.5GW in 2019."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Belgian power system has been coal-free since 2016, when the country became the first EU member state to phase out the technology. The countryâ€™s 6GW nuclear reactor fleet â€“ to be phased out by 2025 â€“ is the source of much disruption, with outages representing a severe threat to security of supply over the winter of 2018. Private players can participate across the power sector, which has been unbundled and liberalized. However, Engieâ€™s subsidiary Electrabel owned some 69% of generation capacity in 2019. Renewables growth has been steady across all main generating technologies, with the penetration of rooftop solar at 10%, the highest in all of Europe."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Clean power LCOEs for utility-scale projects are generally higher than most mature renewables markets in Europe. For instance, the cost range for offshore wind was $83-$104/MWh in the first quarter of 2020, against $55-74/MWh in the Netherlands. For other technologies, the lack of a large-scale auction program has made it difficult to achieve economies of scale. Belgian wholesale prices are largely determined by outages affecting the countryâ€™s reactor fleet and those of its neighbors, from which it imports heavily. Spot prices tend to be slightly higher than those in France, Germany or the Netherlands. Residential and commercial retail power bills have, for their part, steadily risen over the last decade."}]}
