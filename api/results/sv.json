Moreover, El Salvador has high exposure to natural disasters, which increase operating risk."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"El Salvador clean energy attracted $1.1 billion in investment 2010-2019. Over half that was directed to PV plants, which received $663 million, followed by $261 million for biomass and waste projects. Largely due to successful recent clean energy auctions, over 71% has been deployed 2016-2019. In 2019 alone, El Salvador clean energy attracted $85 million, all for wind projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"El Salvador’s government is focused on diversifying its power matrix and cutting its oil dependency by adding renewable energy capacity. Since 2013 the country has held three auctions, contracting 285MW of renewable capacity. It offers income and import tax exemptions to clean energy projects and guarantees priority dispatch to clean electricity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"El Salvador’s renewables boom is set to continue with more project completions in the next two years. Still, the country remains highly dependent on fossil fuels and hydro, exposing its market to price spikes during droughts and periods of high oil prices. Investment in renewables is seen as a path to reducing these impacts."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"El Salvador had 2.1GW of installed capacity in 2019. Oil and diesel constitute the single largest source, with 35% of the total, followed by large hydro with 25%. Among renewables, biomass and geothermal dominate, with 13% (294MW) and 9% (204MW), respectively. PV capacity reached 269MW in 2019, compared to 104MW in 2017. El Salvador’s power market has been unbundled and generation is open to private operators. The country is part of the Central American Electrical Interconnected System and is connected to Guatemala and Honduras by 286km of transmission lines. From January through September 2019, El Salvador added 84MW to its grid with two PV projects commissioned. In March 2019, Real Infrastructure Capital Partners completed a portfolio of three PV plants with a combined capacity of 44MW in the city of Acajutla. In July 2019, AES El Salvador and the Guatemalan Corporación Multi Inversiones (CMI) installed 40MW of the 100MW Bosforo PV portfolio. Those plants are located in the cities of Santa Ana, San Sebastián Salitrillo, Sonsonate and Jiquilisco. With these new additions, El Salvador’s solar capacity jumped 58% in less than a year."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"From 2015 to 2016, commercial, residential, industrial and wholesale electricity prices in El Salvador slipped by an average 20%. However, dry conditions in 2016 reduced reservoir levels, hurt hydropower production and fossil fuel generation ramped. Power prices rose as a result. In 2019, commercial prices dipped slightly to $213/MWh. Residential and wholesale prices rose 7% and 5%, respectively, over the same period, while industrial prices jumped 17%."}]}
