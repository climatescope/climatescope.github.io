barriers to the roll-out of renewables are moderate, including the lengthy development process, lack of experience within government, and insufficient spatial planning.

The size and budget of the subsidy scheme will limit the deployment of renewables, unless a corporate PPA market emerges."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in clean energy over the last few years has been minimal, ranking last out of all EU member states in 2018. Investment levels should increase slightly, as the winning auction projects begin to close financing."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Slovenia aims to source 43% of its electricity from renewable energy by 2030. Based on announced policies, Slovenia will not be able to reach the target.  In March 2018, the country published its long-term energy strategy, committing to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The results from the latest renewables and CHP auction, announced in June 2018, saw wind projects securing most of the feed-in premium support, at 109MW. This compared with 11.4MW for solar and the remaining 9MW being biomass, CHP and hydro. The auction system is meant to provide investor certainty. However, it lacks size in terms of budget and projects, procuring just 129MW with 10 million euros, limiting the renewables growth somewhat."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Unlike many European countries, Slovenia has seen power demand rising slowly in the last few years, providing the impetus for further build-out of generating capacity and/or interconnection with neighboring countries. Much of the country's hydro resources have already been exploited and, with high costs of new nuclear power plants, it is renewables that will likely benefit from this growth in demand. While the renewables subsidy program remains limited to small projects, developers may explore other revenue streams such as corporate power purchase agreements or PPAs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Slovenia's capacity mix is dominated by nuclear and hydro plants, which together provide nearly three-quarters of the electricity consumed. And, according to the government's long-term strategy (known as the 'Energy Concept'), the reliance on nuclear will continue with a 20-year life extension for its Krsko plant to 2043. In addition, growth in renewables is expected to continue, thanks to the support system and priority dispatch for these generators. Slovenia relies heavily on energy imports from its neighbors, having met 56% of its energy needs from domestic resources in 2018. The electricity market has been open to competition since 2007, with a variety of generators and retailers available to consumers. However, much of the market remains in the hands of state-owned players."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Slovenia's residential electricity prices saw an increase to 165 euros/MWh in 2019 after remaining steady at 160 euros/MWh over 2013-18. Following rising carbon prices, there has been upwards pressure on power prices in neighboring countries such as Italy and Austria. Several power and gas companies in Slovakia have also pushed prices up. The substantial penetration of hydro and nuclear power in Slovenia helps keep electricity tariffs low for consumers, as wholesale prices remain low. With such a mix, the addition of wind and solar only help to keep costs low. The limited subsidies the government hands out typically get added to electricity bills in the form of taxes and levies."}]}
