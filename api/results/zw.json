Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act, which required that at least 51% of shares in any business be held by indigenous Zimbabweans, impeded foreign investment. In March 2018, the requirement was removed, and foreigners can now own 100% of a company in Zimbabwe except for platinum and diamond mining companies. This should open the door for more foreign investment. Corruption is a problem and it impedes international investment. A solar plant project that was earmarked to be built in Gwanda stalled after allegations that funds were misappropriated at the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Solar is the most commonly funded form of renewable energy, but total investment in clean energy is negligible to date. Most of the capital for funding renewable development comes from foreign investors, but many are wary of political and regulatory risks. Renewable-energy investors have asked for policy changes, such as more relaxed licensing rules for small producers. Prior to 2018, all businesses in Zimbabwe were required to be majority-owned by a local, which dissuaded foreign participation in the renewable energy market. Overall economic stability is also a concern. The government outlawed all foreign currency in July 2019 and reintroduced the Zimbabwean dollar as the only form of legal tender. The Zimbabwe dollar was wiped out a decade ago due to hyperinflation with foreign currencies becoming legal tender in 2009. Legitimate worries remain. The Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency reported in August 2020 that annual inflation reached 838% in July."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Zimbabwe's target to reach over 1 gigawatt of renewables by 2025 (excluding large hydro) and over 2GW by 2030 is ambitious, given that the country is essentially starting from zero renewable generation at present and continues to face issues with unmet demand and severe load-shedding. The target is non-binding. Solar is the most promising form of renewable generation, and several IPPs have signed PPAs. In July 2019, the government announced that all new construction projects must include solar and removed import duties on solar energy-related products, from batteries to cables. This should significantly boost the solar market going forward. Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), the public utility, has plans for a 300MW solar project, which would be the first renewable project in its portfolio, but progress appears uncertain. In May 2020, Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) invited bids for the construction of 500MW of PV. Additionally, the Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe issued a request for proposal in September 2019 seeking partners for the development of seven PV plants totaling 235MW. Rural electrification efforts are mostly focused on off-grid solutions. The country is targeting universal access by 2030."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"On average, the country produces around 969MW daily against a peak demand of 2,100MW, resulting in severe load shedding of up to 18 hours per day. Businesses in the country struggle to maintain operations without stable electricity. Due to unreliable generation in the country's own fleet, Zimbabwe imports approximately 400MW from Eskom (South Africa) and EDM (Mozambique) in order to meet demand. This is not sustainable long-term. All of the country's five main generation plants have surpassed their 25-year general lifespan and are in need of modernization. However, funding for this is limited. Despite contending with severe load shedding, Zimbabwe exports 80MW to Namibia via a 15-year agreement signed in 2015. The countries discussed expanding the arrangement in 2019. Renewable energy development can benefit from a 10-year income tax holiday and solar equipment is exempt from import duty as well as VAT, effective July 2019."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"State-owned ZESA is the holding company for both the national generation utility (ZPC) and the T&D utility (ZETDC). Hydro accounts for about half of Zimbabwe's overall power generation, supplied by the Kariba plant on the Zambezi river. Water levels on the river have been low over the past few years, which has contributed greatly to the country's severe load-shedding. The next largest source of generation is coal, which has also been unreliable due to fuel shortages and cost fluctuations. The market for power generation has been liberalized and is open to IPPs, of which there are several, though electricity supply is dominated by ZESA. Regulator ZERA has issued 30 IPP agreements in the past five years and most are for renewable energy (solar). However, only 14 are operational as of March 2020. Participation by the private sector is still low due to capital constraints. ZESA faces major challenges including validating infrastructure, insufficient foreign currency, power theft, and non-payment of bills."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"National electricity tariffs are roughly USD $0.106 per kWh, compared to a regional average of USD $0.14 per kWh, according to ZESA. In reality, Zimbabwe's tariffs are among the highest in the region when accounting for exchange rates. In October 2019, Zimbabwe raised its average electricity tariff by 320% in response to rising fuel prices and inflation stoked by a rapidly depreciating Zimbabwe dollar, which was reintroduced earlier in the year. The tariff increases are expected to enable ZESA to undertake grid maintenance, repair aging coal-fired generation units and cover imports from South Africa and Mozambique. Tariffs were again increased by 20% in March 2020, followed by 50% hikes in both September and in October. The national regulator, ZERA, is operating at a loss and struggling to collect an estimated $1.3 billion owed by defaulters. ZETDC announced in April 2020 that it would begin to disconnect consumers for nonpayment. The government's mandatory rollout of prepaid meters was designed to bring in more stable revenue. According to ZETDC, the program has improved revenue inflows by 35%."}]}
