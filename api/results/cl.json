main barrier to renewables development remains the degree of interconnection between the two sub-systems. Interconnection is critical for enabling solar energy, in particular, produced in the northern SING sub-system and home to the best solar resources, to flow to the center of the country, where population and demand are concentrated. Curtailment of renewables began in Chile in August 2015. Since then, wind and solar power had been curtailed at increasing rates until Cardones-Polpaico was commissioned. Increasing wind and solar development and transmission infrastructure limitations will likely drive curtailment up again. Currently the country has only two transmission lines connecting the two sub-systems, with both operating at full capacity. The government is focused on increasing the flexibility of the grid to allow better integration of intermittent renewable sources."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Chile attracted $16 billion in new clean energy investment over the last seven years. In 2019 alone, the country registered a record of $4.9 billion, up four-fold on the previous year. The country was the second-largest destination for new investment in clean energy in Latin America in 2019, overtaking Mexico. Chile has many types of financial organizations investing in renewables, with development banks, commercial banks and project developers all playing significant roles. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has been the main lead arranger in the country. Although distributed PV generation expanded in 2019 to 42MW from 22MW in 2018, uptake of the technology remains nascent in Chile. In an attempt to boost distributed generation, the government expanded the size limit for installations from 100kW to 300kW in 2018."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Chile’s exceptional natural resources make it attractive for clean energy investment. The government has set ambitious long-term goals for adding clean energy capacity. Targets include a clean energy mandate of 20% of generation for utilities by 2025 and 60% of generation by 2035. Chile generated 22% of its power from clean sources in 2019, which accounted for 25% of total installed capacity. The country postponed an auction planned for 2020 that was expected to contract 5.9TWh/year due to the impact of the pandemic on power demand projections. Auctions in Chile are technology-blind, with wind, solar, gas and other technologies competing head-to-head. In 2014, the government implemented changes to its auction program aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of clean energy. Since then, Chile has held four tenders and contracted 31TWh/year. In two of the last three tenders, renewables accounted for 100% of all generation contracted. In January 2018, the country’s coal generators signed an agreement committing to build no new coal-fired assets. In 2019, the government announced a coal retirement plan that will phase out 1.7GW by 2024, or over 30% of total coal capacity. The plan is the first step of Chile’s decarbonization strategy, which aims to fully retire its coal fleet by 2040."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Chile is the world’s largest copper exporter, with the energy-intensive nature of mining creating substantial power demand. The copper industry alone accounts for nearly half of Chile’s exports. In a given year, mining represents 30% of total power demand in the country. Mining operations are located in the north and are mostly served by the SING sub-system. The majority of coal assets are located in this region, which also has the greatest potential for solar generation in the country. However, the lack of interconnection between SIC and SING has historically driven the majority of solar developments to the SIC sub-system, where over 90% of the population lives and most retail demand is located. This reality may change, however, as integration of the two sub-systems continues and mining companies prioritize procurement of clean power via bilateral power purchase agreements."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Chile has a National Electric System (Sistema Eléctrico Nacional, or SEN) as well as two smaller isolated systems in the south of the country, the Sistema Eléctrico de Aysén (SEA) and Sistema Eléctrico de Magallanes (SEM). The SEN was created with the interconnection of the country’s two primary power systems, the Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande (SING) and the Sistema Interconectado Central (SIC), at the end of 2017. The process of interconnection continued with the commissioning of a second line connecting the two systems in June 2019. The SIC and SING sub-systems together account for 99% of Chile’s total installed capacity, at 18GW and 7GW, respectively. In 2019, Chile had 2.7GW of solar and 1.6GW of wind capacity, representing 18% of the country’s total installed capacity. Wind and solar alone represented 14% of the country’s total power generation in 2019, up from virtually nothing five years ago."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"In Chile, spot prices are determined by the node of delivery, which takes into account the marginal operating costs of plants, as well as demand at that specific location. Spot prices have shown high volatility in recent years during daytime hours. In 2018, spot prices slipped to zero at times during midday, while shooting back to $60/MWh at night. The same pattern had been observed in previous years, but the situation has improved with the interconnection of the country’s main power subsystems, the SIC (Sistema Interconectado Central) and SING (Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande). In 2019, after the commissioning of an important transmission line (Cardones-Polpaico) spot prices across the main nodes converged and decreased considerably. The government applied a price stabilization mechanism to retail tariffs in 2019 in response to social unrest that erupted in the country."}]}
