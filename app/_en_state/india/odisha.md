###Score summary

Odisha scored 0.649 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 5<sup>th</sup> among the six Indian states surveyed, marginally ahead of Bihar. It was either last or second-last on all parameters.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the state scored 0.664. Its relatively weak performance reflected, among other things, the incomplete unbundling and privatisation of its power sector. 

Odisha scored zero on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, as did four other Indian states. It did not attract any investment in 2015, or in the four previous years.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, it scored 1.533 and placed last. The state has 16 clean energy value chains, but no distributed clean energy companies. 

Odishaâ€™s 1 score on Parameter IV ranked it 5<sup>th</sup> among the six states. It has undertaken some carbon-offsetting activities, but has not adopted any carbon policies or corporate awareness initiatives.
