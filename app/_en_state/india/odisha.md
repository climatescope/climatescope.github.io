Odisha, located on the east coast of India, is rich in natural resources, having large reserves of iron ore, bauxite (aluminium ore) and coal. This has made it home to a large number of steel and aluminium manufacturers, as well as coal power generators. The state had no power deficit during the year 2016-17.

The total installed power generation capacity in the state is 11,214MW, of which around 79% is coal-based, while large hydro accounts for about 19%. The balance consists of small hydro plants, biomass and solar PV. The total installed solar PV capacity at the end of 2016 was 77MW but only 10MW was added in 2016. 

Odisha released its renewable energy policy in November 2016, which covers the period to 2022. The state’s share of the 175GW renewable energy target by 2022 announced by the federal government is 2,377MW of solar power. In addition to adopting this federal solar target, the state announced a target of 200MW of wind power, 150MW of small hydro, 180MW of biomass and 20MW of power from municipal solid waste in the new policy.

Odisha was the first state in India to initiate power sector reforms when it introduced a program of change in the 1990s. The state privatized its four electricity distribution utilities in 1999. Three of these – Western Electricity Supply Company of Odisha, North Eastern Electricity Supply Company of Odisha and Southern Electricity Supply Company of Odisha – were, until recently, owned by India’s largest private sector power company Reliance Infra. The fourth  was initially under the control of AES Transpower, which exited the business in 2001. The utility has been under state government control since then.

In March 2015, Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission cancelled the licences of the three Reliance Infra-controlled distribution utilities, citing violation of the Electricity Act and inability to reduce the distribution losses. The electricity distribution utilities and most other commercial entities do not meet their mandatory renewable energy purchase obligations. In 2015, the state electricity regulatory commission issued orders for compliance. However, these were stayed by the state high court after petitions from the obligated commercial entities.

In October 2015, a 1,000MW solar park to be developed in the state was approved by the federal government. The land is yet to be identified as of August 2017. Additionally, the state also planned to auction 500MW of solar projects under the National Solar Mission. This capacity was later reduced to 270MW and the winners were announced in August 2016. The proposed solar park, in addition to the upcoming auctions, are expected to increase developer interest in the state. In May 2015, the state electricity regulatory commission amended the net metering regulations, extending their scope to all buildings, from an initial order limiting the regulation to government buildings. In August 2016, the commission revised the regulations again to allow consumers to install solar PV systems going up to 75% of the distribution transformer capacity, against the previous cap of 30%. The Green Energy Development Corporation of Odisha and the Central Electricity Supply Utility (one of Odisha’s distribution utilities) signed a 25-year project implementation agreement with Azure Power in July 2016 to develop a grid-connected solar rooftop project. It will have a minimum capacity of 4MW and involve more than 100 government buildings in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The state is planning to add 70MW of rooftop solar PV capacity by 2022.

Odisha has a low level of rural electrification and low per capita income. The tribal areas of the state have particularly low levels of energy access. It is estimated that 3.7 million rural households in the state did not have access to electricity as of August 2017. While the federal government’s rural electrification program is active in Odisha, the progress of projects and the awarding of new projects has been very slow. The sluggish pace of grid extension and off-grid rural electrification indicates that the rural electrification targets set by the federal government may not be achieved before the deadline.
