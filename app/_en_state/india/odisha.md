Odisha, located on the east coast of India, is rich in natural resources, having large reserves of iron ore, bauxite (aluminium ore) and coal. This has made it home to a large number of steel and aluminium manufacturers, as well as coal power generators. The state had a marginal power deficit of 0.6% in the last fiscal year (ended March 2016), but no peak time power deficit.  

The total installed power generation capacity in the state is 10,854MW, of which around 78% is coal-based, while large hydro accounts for about 20%. The balance consists of small hydro plants, biomass and solar PV. Solar capacity more than doubled in 2015 to reach 67MW by the end of the year. 

Odisha is finalising its renewable energy policy, which will cover the period to 2022. The state’s share of the 175GW by 2022 renewable energy target announced by the federal government is 2,377MW of solar power. In addition to adopting this federal solar target, the state is expected to announce a target of 350MW of wind power, 150MW of small hydro, 180MW of biomass and 20MW of power from municipal solid waste in the new policy. 

Odisha was the 1<sup>st</sup> state in India to initiate power sector reforms when it introduced a programme of change in the 1990s. The state privatised its four electricity distribution utilities in 1999. Three of these – Western Electricity Supply Company of Odisha Limited, North Eastern Electricity Supply Company of Odisha Limited and Southern Electricity Supply Company of Odisha Limited – were, until recently, owned by India’s largest private power company Reliance Infra. The 4<sup>th</sup> was initially under the control of AES Transpower, but it left the business in 2001. The utility has been under state government control since then.

In March 2015, Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission cancelled the licences of the three Reliance Infra-controlled distribution utilities, citing violation of the Electricity Act and inability to reduce the distribution losses. 
The electricity distribution utilities and most other commercial entities do not meet their mandatory renewable energy purchase obligations. In 2015, the state electricity regulatory commission issued orders for compliance. However, these were stayed by the state high court after petitions from the obligated commercial entities.

In October 2015, a 1,000MW solar park to be developed in the state was approved by the federal government. The location has yet to be finalised. The state is also planning to auction 500MW of solar projects under the National Solar Mission. The proposed solar park, in addition to the upcoming auctions, is expected to increase developer interest in the state. 

In May 2015, the state electricity regulatory commission amended the net metering regulations, extending their scope to all buildings, from an initial order limiting the regulation to government buildings. In August 2016, the commission revised the regulations again to allow consumers to install solar PV systems up to 75% of the distribution transformer capacity, up from the previous cap of 30%. 
The Green Energy Development Corporation of Odisha and the Central Electricity Supply Utility (one of Odisha’s distribution utilities) signed a 25-year project implementation agreement with Azure Power in July 2016 to develop India’s first grid-connected solar rooftop project. It will have a minimum capacity of 4MW and involve more than 100 government buildings in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The state is planning to add 70MW of rooftop solar PV capacity by 2022.

Odisha has a low level of rural electrification and low per capita income. The tribal areas of the state have particularly low levels of energy access. It is estimated that 4.3m rural households in the state did not have access to electricity as of June 2016. While the federal government’s rural electrification programme is active in Odisha, the progress of projects and the awarding of new projects has been very slow. The sluggish pace of grid extension and off-grid rural electrification indicates that the rural electrification targets set by the federal government may not be achieved before the deadlines.


###Score summary

Odisha scored 0.649 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 5<sup>th</sup> among the six Indian states surveyed, marginally ahead of Bihar. It was either last or second-last on all parameters.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the state scored 0.664. Its relatively weak performance reflected, among other things, the incomplete unbundling and privatisation of its power sector. 

Odisha scored zero on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, as did four other Indian states. It did not attract any investment in 2015, or in the four previous years.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, it scored 1.533 and placed last. The state has 16 clean energy value chains, but no distributed clean energy companies. 

Odisha’s 1 score on Parameter IV ranked it 5<sup>th</sup> among the six states. It has undertaken some carbon-offsetting activities, but has not adopted any carbon policies or corporate awareness initiatives.
