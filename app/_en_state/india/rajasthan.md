Rajasthan holds an important place on India’s renewable energy map due to its barren lands, exceptional sun, and strong winds. It is a top choice for developers of large-scale solar projects and has seen rapid growth in wind power generation due to favorable feed-in tariffs.

Renewable energy at 4GW represents a high share (32%) of total power capacity of 13GW compared to other states. This is led by wind with 3GW and followed by 856MW of solar. Overall renewable energy capacity grew by 14% in 2014. 

Rajasthan has done little policy-wise to encourage solar development through incentives and the state's distribution utilities are among the financially shakiest in India. Rajasthan conducted only one solar tender of 100MW in 2013 and has not granted permits for any new capacity under state incentives. However, in 2014 it did modify its land policies to ease developer access to land clearances.

Most solar capacity built to date has been under the federal government’s Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission. India's overall ambitious targets are expected to continue driving solar growth in the state which is slated to become the national leader for most installed capacity in 2015.
