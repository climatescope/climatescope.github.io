Madhya Pradesh, located in central India, is one of the most agricultural states in the country. Installed renewable electricity capacity of 2,058MW accounted for just over 10% of the state’s total of 20,483MW. 
The state almost doubled its wind capacity in 2015 to 1,126MW. A further 1,015MW was added in Q1 2016 (taking the total to 2,141MW), reflecting a rush among wind power developers to commission plants before the expiry of the 2013-2016 feed-in-tariff of INR 5.92 per kWh ($9.22 cents per kWh). 

A new wind feed-in tariff of INR 4.78 per kWh ($7.45 cents per kWh) will run for three years from 1 April 2016. The decrease in the tariffs has resulted in diminished developer interest in the state.
The state added 322MW of solar power in 2015. This took its total grid-connected solar capacity to 679MW, a growth rate of more than 90% in 2015. 

Madhya Pradesh’s share of the 175GW by 2022 renewable energy target announced by the federal government is 5,675MW of solar, 6,200MW of wind, 118MW of biomass and 25MW of small hydro power.
In 2015, the state finalised its net metering policy, which provides incentives to consumers to install rooftop solar PV systems. The policy introduced exemptions from banking (whereby power producers can virtually ‘bank’ or store power in the grid), wheeling (transmission) and cross-subsidy charges to consumers and is expected to propel the growth of the rooftop solar sector. 

The land availability and acquisition issues that have hampered growth of renewables in certain other states do not pose major concerns for project developers in Madhya Pradesh. The state leases government land at a token fee of INR 1 ($0.015)/year, which has made Madhya Pradesh one of the most attractive places in the country for solar developers. Favourable land policy and a single window for project clearance has resulted in faster project commissioning.
In early 2016, the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation partnered with the government of Madhya Pradesh and the Solar Energy Corporation of India to set up a 750MW ‘ultra mega solar power’ project, which was advertised as the world’s largest single-site solar project. The state government is planning to provide payment guarantees for the project.  

All three state distribution companies were rated ‘B’ in recent rankings released by the Ministry of Power, which represents below average operational and financial performance capability. Despite the recent rapid deployment of new renewable energy capacity in the state, the poor health of its distribution utilities has resulted in payment delays to wind power developers of up to six months.
In August 2016, Madhya Pradesh signed up to the federal government’s distribution utility debt restructuring scheme, Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojna (UDAY). This is expected to provide short-term financial relief to the distribution companies. Their long-term turnaround, however, will depend on their ability to reduce distribution losses and improve bill collection efficiencies.

The state has made good progress in rural electrification through grid extension (as per the federal government’s definition of electrification, which considers a village to be electrified if 10% of households have power). The rural electrification projects that were supposed to be completed through off-grid options remain to be tendered for, as of August 2016. The rural electrification targets set by the federal government may not be achieved on schedule.


###Score summary

Madhya Pradesh scored 0.863 in Climatescope 2016, earning it 2<sup>nd</sup> place among the six Indian states included in this year’s survey. Its best position was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Madhya Pradesh scored 0.985, placing it behind only Andhra Pradesh. Its unbundled power sector, wholesale power market and availability of finance helped to boost its score.

The state scored zero on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, as did four other Indian states. It did not attract any investment in 2015, or in the five previous years. 

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, Madhya Pradesh scored 1.878 and was placed 3<sup>rd</sup>. Its score was supported by the presence of 20 clean energy value chains.

The state’s 1.250 on Parameter IV put it in 1<sup>st</sup> place. This reflected its performance on carbon-offsetting activities, in particular its Clean Development Mechanism emissions reduction projects.
