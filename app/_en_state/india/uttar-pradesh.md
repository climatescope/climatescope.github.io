India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, had India’s highest power deficit in 2015. The power shortage, defined as the gap between maximum demand and availability, reached a record level of 23.4% in 2015.
The state has historically been India’s largest sugarcane producer and therefore a considerable proportion (9%) of its installed capacity is biomass and waste-fired. In 2015, the state added 160MW of biomass and waste, taking the total installed capacity of such generating units in the state to 1,992MW. These have a relatively low capacity utilisation factor and mostly generate power only for a quarter of the year because of a lack of feedstock.

There is growing interest in utility-scale solar PV in the state. Uttar Pradesh saw year-on-year growth of 536% in solar energy capacity in 2015. Total grid-connected installed solar capacity at the end of December 2015 was 140MW, up from 22MW at the end of December 2014. 
The federal government plans to add 175GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022. Of this, the state’s share is 10.6GW of solar power, 3.5GW of biomass power and 25MW of small hydro capacity. These targets, and the growing mandatory renewable energy purchase obligations of the state electricity distribution companies, are expected to drive the long-term growth of renewables, particularly solar energy, in the state. 

There is no VAT or entry tax on solar energy equipment and products in the state. In addition, there are stamp duty concessions and no wheeling (transmission) charges for solar energy. The state also provides transmission infrastructure support by bearing the cost of extending the network to solar power projects installed in the Bundelkhand region of the state.
In the past, the structure of power purchase agreements signed with state power utilities was a concern for the developers and resulted in high project bids by developers. More recently, however, there has been interest in the Solar Energy Corporation of India tenders under the Viability Gap Funding scheme at a scheme bid price of INR 4.43 per kWh ($6.62 cents per kWh).

The financial health of the state power distribution companies is among the worst in the country. Ratings released in June 2016 by the Ministry of Power downgraded two of the five state distribution utilities compared with last year. Their weak financial health has resulted in payment delays to conventional energy generators in the past and remains a key concern for new project developers. 
Uttar Pradesh has some of the lowest levels of rural household electrification in the country. The government estimates that around 17.5m rural households in the state lack access to electricity. Rural electrification efforts in the state are underway through grid extension as well as off-grid technologies. 

The lack of reliable power in rural areas has created an opportunity for installation of mini-grids, and many have been deployed, often with the support of domestic and international grants. In early 2016, Uttar Pradesh became the first state in India to adopt a mini-grid policy. It was also the first state in India to set-up state-sponsored mini-grid projects through competitive bidding.


###Score summary

Uttar Pradesh scored 0.708 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 4<sup>th</sup> among the six Indian states surveyed. Its best performance was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. 

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the state scored 0.727 and was ranked 4<sup>th</sup>. Its relatively weak performance reflected, among other things, the incomplete unbundling and privatisation of its power sector. 

Uttar Pradesh scored zero on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, as did four other Indian states. It did not attract any investment in 2015.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the state scored 1.618 and was placed 4<sup>th</sup>. The state has 17 clean energy value chains spread across wind, solar, biomass, biofuel and small hydro.

Uttar Pradesh’s 1.167 score on Parameter IV put it 2<sup>nd</sup> place, equal with Bihar and beneath Madhya Pradesh. It has undertaken some carbon offsetting activities, but has not put any carbon policies in place.
