Bihar, located in the east of India, is the 13th largest state in terms of area, but has the third highest population. Approximately 85% of people live in rural areas. The state has one of the lowest levels of rural electrification in the country with only 45.62% of the households having access to electricity as on June 30, 2017.

By the end of 2016, total installed power generation capacity in Bihar was 4,802MW. More than 94% of this is coal-based, with small hydro, solar and biomass accounting for the balance. There were no grid-connected wind power plants in the state at the end of 2016. However, installations in the renewable energy sector in the state have picked up in the last fiscal year. 

Some of the state’s first solar PV projects were developed under a feed-in tariff scheme. However, auctions are expected to become the preferred route for capacity addition in the future. Bihar is heavily dependent on federal government-owned power plants and purchases power from the power exchanges to meet its daily power requirement. The 210MW coal-fired power plant owned by the Bihar State Power Generation Company has been offline since 2013 for modernization, while state-owned hydro power plants have been operating at low capacities. A very small fraction of power is obtained from biomass-based plants in the state.

Bihar’s share of the 175GW renewable energy target by 2022 announced by the federal government is 2,493MW of solar, 244MW of biomass and 25MW of small hydro power. In 2012, the Bihar State Electricity Board was legally unbundled into five different companies with responsibility for generation, transmission and distribution of power. However, these new companies still operate under the umbrella of, and are managed by, a holding company that procures power for the two distribution utilities.

These distribution companies had very high technical and commercial losses of almost 44% in 2015-16. The state’s electricity tariffs are among the lowest in India, a fact that is reflected in the distribution companies’ high deficits. In addition, the rural areas have a very poor electricity bill payment record. Total distribution company debt in FY2015 was $600 million. The distribution companies in the state have started contracting private companies to collect payments in areas with the worst payment records to improve collection efficiency. Bihar signed up to the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojna or UDAY agreement – the federal government’s distribution utility debt restructuring scheme – in February 2016. This is expected to provide some short-term financial relief to the distribution companies. Their long-term turnaround, however, will depend on their ability to reduce distribution losses, improve bill collection efficiencies and bring tariffs up to a level that covers the costs of generation.

As many as 6.67 million households in rural areas of the state did not have access to electricity as of June 2017. Despite the government’s plans to connect all villages in the state to the grid by March 2017, 5.6 million rural households remain without access to electricity. 

Bihar saw a 4% growth in power demand in 2016. This is expected to increase steadily as more rural people get connected to the grid, which, coupled with the renewable purchase obligations of the distribution utilities, will provide good opportunities for the development of renewable energy projects in the state. Bihar distribution companies have not been meeting their renewable purchase obligations and the state has not yet provided a trajectory for meeting its RPO targets, as directed by the central government.
