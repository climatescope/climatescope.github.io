Bihar, located in the east of India, is the 13<sup>th</sup> largest state in terms of area, but has the third highest population. Approximately 85% of people live in rural areas. The state has one of the lowest levels of rural electrification in the country, and the peak power deficit stood at 6.7% in the last financial year, which ended in March 2016.

Total installed power generation capacity in Bihar is 4,403MW. More than 97% of this is coal-based, with small hydro and biomass accounting for the balance. There were no grid-connected solar or biomass plants at the end of 2015. However, by the end of July 2016, the state had added 80MW of grid-connected solar PV.

Some of the state’s first solar PV projects were (or are being) developed under a feed-in tariff scheme. However, auctions are expected to become the preferred route for capacity addition in the future.  
Bihar is heavily dependent on federal government-owned power plants and purchases power from the power exchanges to meet its daily power requirement. The 210MW coal-fired power plant owned by the Bihar State Power Generation Company has been offline since 2013 for modernisation, while state-owned hydro power plants have been operating at low capacities. A very small fraction of power is obtained from biomass power plants in the state.  

Bihar’s share of the 175GW by 2022 renewable energy target announced by the federal government is 2,493MW of solar, 244MW of biomass and 25MW of small hydro power.
In 2012, the Bihar State Electricity Board was legally unbundled into five different companies with responsibility for generation, transmission and distribution of power. However, these new companies still operate under the umbrella of, and are managed by, a holding company that procures power for the two distribution utilities.

These distribution companies have very high technical and commercial losses, with one reporting a financial loss of 46.5%. The state’s electricity tariffs are among the lowest in India, a fact that is reflected in the distribution companies’ high deficits. In addition, rural areas have a very poor electricity bill payment record. Total distribution company debt in September 2015 was INR31.1bn ($485m). They have started contracting private companies to collect payments in areas with the worst records to improve collection efficiency. 
Bihar signed up to the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojna or UDAY agreement – the federal government’s distribution utility debt restructuring scheme – in February 2016. This is expected to provide some short-term financial relief to the distribution companies. Their long-term turnaround, however, will depend on their ability to reduce distribution losses, improve bill collection efficiencies and bring tariffs up to a level that covers the costs of generation.

As many as 14.5m households in rural areas of the state did not have access to electricity as of August 2016. Despite the government’s plans to connect all villages in the state to the grid by March 2017, it is expected that millions of rural households will remain without electricity. 
Bihar saw 25% growth in power demand in 2015. This is expected to increase steadily as more rural people get connected to the grid, which, coupled with the renewable purchase obligations of the distribution utilities, will provide good opportunities for the development of renewable energy projects in the state.


###Score summary

Bihar scored 0.630 in Climatescope 2016, placing it last on the list of six Indian states surveyed in the current year. Its highest position was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. 

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Bihar scored 0.533, putting it at the bottom of the pile. Among other things, this reflects its only partially unbundled power sector, its unliberalised retail electricity market and frequent power outages.

The state scored zero on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, as did four other Indian states. It did not attract any investment in 2015, or in the two previous years.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, Bihar scored 1.612, and was placed above only Odisha. Nevertheless, 15 different clean energy value chains were recorded and six service providers.

The state’s 0.167 score on Parameter IV put it in 2<sup>nnd</sup> place, equal with Uttar Pradesh and beneath Madhya Pradesh. In the Carbon Offsets category, the state boasts five Clean Development Mechanism projects.
