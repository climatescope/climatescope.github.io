Andhra Pradesh, located on the south east coast of the Indian peninsula, is the eighth largest state by area. In 2014, the northwestern part of the state was carved out to form a new state, Telangana. The power generating assets were divided up, with 46% in Andhra Pradesh and 54% in Telangana. At the end of 2016, the new, smaller state of Andhra Pradesh had installed renewable energy capacity of 3,697MW, which was just about 18.4% of the total 20,044MW.

Owing to uncertainty post bifurcation, growth in renewables slowed in 2015 compared with 2014, although activity picked up in 2016. As on 31 May 2017, 1,980MW of solar power, 3,604MW of wind power, 89MW of small hydro and 433MW of biomass based power was installed in the state. Municipal solid waste and industrial waste projects totaled 46MW.

Andhra Pradesh finalized policies for solar and wind power in 2015. These set a cumulative capacity target of 5GW of grid-connected solar and 4GW of wind by 2020. The state’s share in the 175GW renewable energy target announced by the federal government for 2022 is 9,834MW of solar, 8,100MW of wind and 543MW of biomass power. Its solar policy also set a target to establish 2.5GW of capacity through state government-sponsored solar parks.

The state provides various incentives to developers of renewables in the form of exemption from transmission and distribution charges for wheeling of power for sale to a third party user within the state, and exemption from distribution losses incurred when injecting solar power at 33kV or below into the grid. It also facilitates 100% ‘banking’ of renewable power with the grid and exempts producers from electricity duty and cross-subsidy charges. Renewable power projects in the state also enjoy ‘must-run’ status as per the state policy and therefore will not face any curtailment.

State electricity distribution companies have a target to procure 2GW of solar power by 2020, as mandated by the state solar policy. According to the May 2017 “Integrated Rating for State Power Distribution Utilities” report released by the Ministry of Power, one of the state’s two distribution utilities - Eastern Power Distribution Company of Andhra Pradesh - was upgraded from ‘B+’ to ‘A’ rating, indicating a huge improvement in the operational and financial performance capability. At the same time, the other distribution company – Southern Power Distribution Company of Andhra Pradesh - was upgraded from ‘B’ to ‘B+’, indicating moderate operational and financial performance. In June 2016, Andhra Pradesh signed the federal government’s distribution utility debt restructuring scheme, the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojna, or UDAY agreement. This will see the state take on debt of 110 billion rupees ($1.71 billion) of its distribution utilities in the year ending March 2017. This was expected to reduce the interest burden of the two distribution companies by 3.3 billion rupees ($ 51.4 million) in 2016. This measure is expected to provide short-term financial relief to the distribution companies. In the longer term, however, any turnaround will depend on their ability to reduce distribution losses and improve bill collection efficiencies.

In March 2016, it was announced that a tender for 400MW of capacity under the National Solar Mission had been awarded at a tariff of 4.43 rupees per kWh ($6.65 cents) under the Viability Gap Funding scheme. Additionally, the state conducted auctions in April 2017 for the 250MW Kadappa solar power park.  Solairedirect Energy, backed by French utility ENGIE Group, won the entire 250MW capacity for a single fixed tariff of 3.15 rupees per kWh ($4.88 cents) for 25 years.  

According to the federal government’s definition of rural electrification – which considers a village to be electrified if 10% of the households have power – the state has already achieved 100% rural electrification. Additionally, all the rural households are electrified as on May 31, 2017. The government is now focusing on system strengthening and metering activities.
