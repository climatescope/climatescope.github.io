West Bengal, located in the east of India, is the fourth most populous state in the country. It has claimed to run a power surplus in the past, and had an average power deficit of just 0.3% during the year 2016-17. The western region of the state is in India’s coal belt. Hence, coal-based power accounts for 14GW or 88% of the state’s total installed capacity of 16,327GW. There is also 1,335MW of large hydro, equivalent to 8% of installed capacity. Renewable power has a small share of the energy mix, with about 567MW installed, or 3.4% of the total. The majority of these plants are biomass and small hydro.

There has been limited development of grid-connected solar and wind power projects. In all, there is less than 65MW installed. 55MW of solar was added in 2016, taking total capacity to 62MW. No wind capacity has been added in the last 10 years, owing to its meagre resource potential. The state has high levels of rural electrification. As of June 2017, only four villages lacked access to the conventional electricity grid although as many as 0.13 million rural households are without electricity access.

West Bengal was the first state in India to install solar mini-grids, which it used to provide electricity to the remote Sundarbans delta region that has traditionally relied on diesel and kerosene to meet its power requirements. The state’s few micro-grids run in parallel with the distribution utility grid network. The state has a net metering policy, but it is limited to large institutional, commercial and business establishments. The uptake has been very low so far. The policy has a cap of 16MW of cumulative installations by the end of the 2017 financial year. 

A private distribution utility supplies power in the state capital Kolkata, which remains profitable due to high collection efficiency. The state-owned distribution utility serves the rest of West Bengal and was rated as ‘B’ by the Ministry of Power recently, which is indicative of below average operational and financial performance capabilities. Both distribution utilities do not meet their mandatory renewable purchase obligations, saying there is a lack of available renewable power in the state.

The federal government has set a target to reach 175GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022. The state’s share of this target is 5.3GW of solar power and 50MW of small hydro capacity. The achievement of these targets is dependent on the state’s ability to attract investments. Some of the utility-scale solar projects that were announced a couple of years ago have yet to materialise. They require large tracts of land, historically a sensitive political issue in the state.
