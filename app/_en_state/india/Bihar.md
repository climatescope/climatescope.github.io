###Score summary

Bihar scored 0.630 in Climatescope 2016, placing it last on the list of six Indian states surveyed in the current year. Its highest position was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. 

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Bihar scored 0.533, putting it at the bottom of the pile. Among other things, this reflects its only partially unbundled power sector, its unliberalised retail electricity market and frequent power outages.

The state scored zero on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, as did four other Indian states. It did not attract any investment in 2015, or in the two previous years.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, Bihar scored 1.612, and was placed above only Odisha. Nevertheless, 15 different clean energy value chains were recorded and six service providers.

The stateâ€™s 0.167 score on Parameter IV put it in 2<sup>nnd</sup> place, equal with Uttar Pradesh and beneath Madhya Pradesh. In the Carbon Offsets category, the state boasts five Clean Development Mechanism projects.
