Located in northeast China just below Heilongjiang, Jilin in 2014 had a nominal GDP of $222bn, up 3.7% from 2013. 

By year-end 2014, Jilin had an overall installed capacity of 25.6GW, of which 70% (17.7GW) was coal-fired power, 14% (3.8GW) was large hydro and the remaining 16% (4.1GW) was wind. In 2014, Jilin generated 83% of its total electricity supply from coal, out a total of 76TWh while large hydro and wind constituted 9.2% and 7.7% respectively. 

In 2012, the Jilin government released its provincial 12th Five-year Plan for New Energy and Renewable Energy Development. It targeted to build 10.5GW wind, 200MW solar PV and 900MW biomass by the end of 2015. While Jilin does have reasonable local natural resources, the targets have proven challenging to meet due to a limited local supply chain and grid infrastructure.

No specific local renewable energy incentives been implemented in Jilin to date. However, in its 12th Five-year Plan for Greenhouse Gas Emission Management released in 2012, Jilin committed to reduce the CO2 intensity of its economy by 17% compared to 2010 levels.  In addition, a provincial CO2 emissions trading system is under preliminary development in Jilin with an eye toward trading starting in 2016.
