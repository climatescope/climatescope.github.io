Bangladesh’s energy system is two-faced when it comes to renewable energy. On one hand, its off-grid solar programme has seen it become the world’s single largest market for solar home system kits, with over 4m sold. On the other, the government sees very limited options for on-grid and utility-scale renewables, and is instead aiming to turn to coal to expand its power sector.

The particular limitation cited is land availability: the country has the world’s highest population density for countries of more than 10m people. As a consequence, it set a target of only 10% renewables by 2020 (around 2GW) under its 2008 dedicated renewable energy policy. This was updated in 2015 under the government’s RE Development Targets to 3.1GW by 2021. This contrasts with the goal of 4.5GW of new coal capacity by 2020 and almost 20GW by 2030 under the Power System Master Plan – 50% of its capacity, from zero today.

As much as 98% of the country’s 10.8GW installed capacity is based on fossil fuels (of which about 70% is natural gas), with large hydro representing the remaining 2%. Due to a rise in economic activity, Bangladesh has installed more than 2GW of oil and diesel based rental power plants since 2009. These rental power plants raised the fuel cost per kWh from $0.014 to $0.04 between 2009 and 2015. They are usually set up by private players for terms of three to seven years, with the purpose of meeting energy deficit, peak deficit and seasonal demand. 

Bangladesh’s Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Agency (SREDA) was formed in 2014 to consolidate policy initiatives and coordinate implementation for renewable energy. For instance, it can receive unsolicited project proposals. The government-owned generation utility, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) is the sole buyer of all of the power generated in the country and sells it to the distribution utilities. Transmission and distribution of electricity is controlled by government owned utilities that serve their respective allocated zones. 

Apart from a range of financing programmes for off-grid solar, solar irrigation, mini-grids, biogas and biomass projects, the country does not have specific incentives for larger projects. A draft feed-in tariff for wind and solar projects stalled in 2015. SREDA is currently focusing on a feed-in tariff for rooftop solar projects – and if it fails to pass government approval will launch rooftop tenders – but these are likely to be for quite limited capacity.

The government has pledged to tender sites on its own land, and there are around 150MW of solar projects in the works. SunEdison also signed an agreement to develop a 200MW project, but since the company’s demise its likelihood is unclear. A 60MW wind project is under development at Cox’s Bazaar, but is progressing slowly, while SREDA is overseeing national wind resource mapping.

The government’s grid extension programme means officially 74% of people have electricity access as of 2015. But this disguises chronic power shortages and load shedding. The Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) has successfully rolled out solar home systems by financing partner organisations to offer 3-year micro-credit to end consumers. There is high potential for more recent IDCOL programmes on solar irrigation, and to a lesser extent mini-grids. The government’s “500MW by 2016” solar programme is moving slowly, with around 150MW of utility-scale project having been tendered.

###Score summary

Bangladesh scored 1.40 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 25<sup>th</sup> among countries overall. Its score was higher than on the previous year’s survey, yet it dropped one place on the list. Its best performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Bangladesh was placed 25<sup>th</sup>.The country’s off-grid policies, in particular those related to energy access and distributed power, supported its score in this category. 

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, its score dropped as new money for the sector failed to materialise in 2015. It was ranked a relatively poor 45<sup>th</sup>.

Bangladesh’s score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III edged slightly higher and it was placed 16<sup>th</sup>, reflecting the presence of a relatively large number of value chains and service providers. 

On Parameter IV its score increased and it took 18<sup>th</sup> place as further corporate awareness initiatives and carbon mitigation measures were introduced.
