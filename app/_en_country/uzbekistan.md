Uzbekistan is one of the most populous countries in Central Asia with around 31.3 million inhabitants. The power sector of the country is amongst the most inefficient ones in the world. It is in the hands of a state owned utility faced with the challenges of operating soviet era infrastructure and delivering electricity at subsidized rates.  In 2017 the government took some initial steps towards readying the sector for the major investments it requires.   

The government published its 2017-2025 plan for the energy sector in June 2017. It aims to increase the country’s 14.1GW generating capacity by 35% over the period through a combination of 5.4GW of new fossil fuel capacity and 2GW of renewables, compensating for an estimated 2.3GW of plant retirements over the period. New hydro and refurbishments will account for the majority of the renewables capacity, with solar PV expected to reach 450MW and onshore wind 300MW by 2025. These targets follow a 2016 report in which the government made improving the country’s energy efficiency a priority, aiming to half consumption by 2030 from 2015 levels.  

Power generation capacity in Uzbekistan is dominated by fossil fuels which account for 87% of the capacity mix, the vast majority of which are gas plants using domestic resources. Hydro provides the rest of the power. Until 2017 the generation, transmission and distribution was operated by UzbekEnergo, a state-owned utility, and its regional representations responsible for retailing electricity. In spring 2017 the government acted that UzbekEnergo’s hydro activities be spun-off to the newly created UzbekHydroEnergo. A similar entity is expected to be created to develop and operate renewable energy projects.

These changes are a first sign that the country’s new president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev who replaced Islam Karimov who headed the state for 25 years in 2016, is seeking to tackle the country’s energy sector challenges. It is still unclear under which power sector structure and regulation Uzbekistan will attempt to modernize its electricity generation and transport infrastructure. The first two solar PV projects developed with the support of the Asian Development Bank were also put on hold and being reviewed as a result of the reorganization of the sector. 

The June 2017 announcements also went some way towards starting renewable energy sector activity in the country. Renewables project of size of up to 30MW can be set up for self-generation and are allowed to sell their excess electricity back to the grid or directly to other large consumers. Low retail electricity prices (131.4 sum per kWh as of October 2016, equivalent to around $ 25 cents per kWh at the June 2016 official exchange rate) are a clear disincentive to self-generation, however, the decreasing reliability of retail electricity supply and falling cost of renewables could lead some companies to install their own power supplies. The presidential order also introduced a duty exemption for renewables project until 2022.
