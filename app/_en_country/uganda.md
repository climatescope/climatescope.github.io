###Score summary

Uganda scored 2.05 in Climatescope 2016, up from 1.68 the previous year. This increase carried it two places higher to rank 7<sup>th</sup> overall. Its best performance came on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Uganda’s score sank by a small margin. The sector’s low barriers to entry and the relative strength of its clean energy policy environment are supportive factors.

On Parameter II, the country’s score more than doubled thanks to a sharp rise in the volume of investment to $189m in 2015, compared with approximately $50m across all sectors over the last four years.

Uganda ranked 8<sup>th</sup> on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III. Its score is supported by its distributed energy sector, both in terms of the diversity of the value chains present and number of service providers.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV it scored higher owing to improvements in its carbon policies. It ranked 13<sup>th</sup> globally, and third in Africa behind South Africa and Kenya.
