#### Score Summary

Mexico scored 2.02 in Climatescope 2016 (up from 1.72 in the previous survey), ranking it ninth overall, two places below its position in 2015. The country’s lowest position was on Enabling Framework Parameter I, but it was also the scene of some improvement. 

It took 29th place on Parameter I, an increase of three places, and its score jumped to 1.37 from 1.10. This reflected an improvement in its power sector structure, specifically the privatisation and unbundling of the power utility and introduction of a wholesale power market. 

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, its score climbed from 0.85 the previous year to 1.54 and it edged up one place to 11th. This was thanks chiefly to the seismic investment of $4.1bn, mainly in wind.
 
Mexico’s score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III was unchanged at 3.84 and it remained in 7th place. Some 27 value chains were identified and five types of financial institution.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV it took 6th position thanks to a strong set of clean energy policies and its carbon offsetting activities.
