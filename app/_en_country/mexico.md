Mexico is the second largest power market in Latin America (after Brazil), and one of the key clean energy markets in the world. 

Mexico has 73GW of installed capacity, in which renewables represent 9%. This share is set to increase as the country attracts new funds for projects. In 2015, Mexico was among the top 10 destinations in the world for new clean energy investment, attracting a total of $4 billion. 

Mexico’s power market is undergoing a profound transformation, moving away from a power sector controlled by a vertically integrated utility to a liberalized generation market with more opportunities for private companies. The energy reform started in 2013 and will be fully implemented by 2018. Among the power market mechanisms introduced by the reform are the unbundling of state-owned utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), creation of an independent system operator, Centro Nacional de Control de Energía, auctions in the wholesale, capacity, medium and long-term markets. Mexico also allows transmission rights (Derechos Financieros de Transmisión) to be acquired by market participants, with prices dependent on node and hour block.

Mexico’s energy reform entered its implementation phase in 2015 with the publication of the clean energy power auction rules. In March 2016, it was announced that the first auction had contracted 394MW of wind and 1.7GW of PV projects for an average price of $48/MWh. 

It is expected that these projects alone will attract more than $2 billion in investment in the next two years. Some of the winning projects will use locally manufactured equipment, like PV panels and wind towers. 

In 2016, Mexico’s energy reform implementation continued. At the end of January in that year, the wholesale market started operations, albeit with limited liquidity. A second long-term auction was held in September 2016. It contracted a total of 1.9GW of solar and 1.2GW of wind plants for a record low average price in Latin America: $33.5/MWh. 

Electricity rates in Mexico have been falling, driven by CFE’s reduction of generation costs. Between 2014 and 2015, tariffs decreased around 25%, going from $0.14/kWh in 2014 to $0.10/kWh in 2015. Mexico has a net metering policy and is a potential market for distributed generation. Installations of residential PV systems more than doubled in the past two years, jumping from 118MW in 2015 to 244MW in 2016, the largest amount of distributed generation in Latin America. 

Mexico has an aggressive mandate to generate 35% of its power from clean sources by 2024. The government’s definition of clean energy includes wind, solar, geothermal and biomass, as well as hydro, nuclear and efficient cogeneration. To help achieve this target, the new power market rules established clean energy certificates, imposing on all large consumers a minimum level of consumption from emission-free technologies. The target for 2018 was set at 5% for all large consumers, including CFE. This will increase to 5.8% in 2019, 7.4% in 2020, 10.9% in 2021 and 13.9% in 2022. 

Ahead of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in Paris in November 2015, Mexico was one of the first developing countries to submit its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), committing unconditionally to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 22% relative to business as usual (BAU) scenario by 2030. Mexico also committed to a further reduction of GHG emissions by 36% below the BAU scenario by 2030. This reduction is conditioned upon availability of international support. 

###Score summary

Mexico scored 2.02 in Climatescope 2016 (up from 1.72 in the previous survey), ranking it 9<sup>th</sup> overall, two places below its position in 2015. The country’s lowest position was on Enabling Framework Parameter I, but it was also the scene of some improvement. 

It took 29<sup>th</sup> place on Parameter I, an increase of three places, and its score jumped to 1.37 from 1.10. This reflected an improvement in its power sector structure, specifically the privatisation and unbundling of the power utility and introduction of a wholesale power market. 

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, its score climbed from 0.85 the previous year to 1.54 and it edged up one place to 11<sup>th</sup>. This was thanks chiefly to the seismic investment of $4.1bn, mainly in wind.
 
Mexico’s score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III was unchanged at 3.84 and it remained in 7<sup>th</sup> place. Some 27 value chains were identified and five types of financial institution.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV it took 6<sup>th</sup> position thanks to a strong set of clean energy policies and its carbon offsetting activities.
