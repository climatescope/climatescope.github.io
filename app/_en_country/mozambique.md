Mozambique’s power sector consists predominantly of hydro-electric power generation. However, this mix can be expected to change in the future following large discoveries of coal reserves and offshore natural gas. The Ministry of Energy oversees the power sector, while the National Electricity Council (CNELEC) acts as the regulator, however, its scope is under revision with the aim of broadening and strengthening its role. The National Fund for Rural Electrification (FUNAE) is charged with implementing off-grid projects.

The market is currently structured around Electricidade de Mocambique (EDM) that is a state-owned and vertically integrated company that is responsible for the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. In the generation side, EDM has 20% of the country’s capacity, however, it receives all power produced by Independent Power Producers (IPP) and by the 2.1GW Cahora Bassa Hydro (HCB). The last one is majority owned by the Mozambican state (92.5%) and exports almost 90% of its total generation. HCB power generation is mainly exported to South Africa, through the South African public utility Eskom’s transmission grid.

Mozambique faces the great challenge of implementing electricity transmission and distribution systems. The national transmission grid is in fact three separate grids – the Southern System, which serves the capital city Maputo, the Central System, and the Northern System, where the Cahora Bassa hydro plant is located. Whilst there is some interconnection between the Northern and Central Systems. However, the main electricity generation, in the north, is not interconnected with the main consumption center, in the south. For that reason, Mozambique has to import part of its electricity produced by HCB from South Africa to supply the south of the country’s demand, especially to the Mozambique’s Mozal aluminum smelter industry. The power is supplied through HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) lines, owned by MATRACO, a joint venture transmission company between Eskom, EDM and Swaziland Electricity Board (SEB).

Agricultural growth and discoveries of coal and natural gas reserves have boosted Mozambique’s economy. However, the GDP dropped to 3.3% growth in 2016, down from 6.6% in 2015. It has been mainly affected by the decline on international commodity prices plus the effects of regional drought. In the power sector, aging transmission and distribution networks create capacity constraints and difficulties for maintenance and collection.

As of 2016, Mozambique’s installed generating capacity was 2.6GW, and Cahora Bassa large hydro accounted for 78% of this. The remaining capacity is comprised of thermal plants and small hydro. Due to the country’s natural resources, the energy mix is beginning to transform from a strictly hydro mix to a more diversified one.

On 10 August 2011, the Public-Private Partnership (IPP) law was published, opening up a space for private generators. All IPPs must sell electricity to EDM and negotiate prices on a contract-by-contract basis. As of May 2017, the country had four IPP plants operating. In 2012, 100MW AGGREEKO’s thermal plants portfolio came on line. In 2015, the 175MW CTEG and 120MW Gigawatt thermal plants we commissioned. In March 2016, the floating 115MW Nacala thermal plant was inaugurated.

On 17 October 2014, Mozambique’s feed-in tariff (FiT) was established via Decree No. 58, aiming to provide price premiums to small-scale projects from 10kW to 10MW for biomass, small hydro, solar and wind. Although the decree is available, injection of power into the grid cannot happen yet as some regulation is still to be approved. As of May 2017, the FiT mechanism was under revision. Biofuels are viewed as an important sector for development within the country. In 2009, a national policy and strategy for biofuels was released, which seeks to develop the biofuels sector. In 2011, the blending mandate and tax schedule for biofuels was released.

###Score summary

Mozambique scored 0.80 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 48<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, a decline of seven places from its position in 2015. The country’s highest score was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Mozambique lost five places to rank 48<sup>th</sup>. Its score was supported by its relatively robust distributed energy framework.

The country also took 49<sup>th</sup> position on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, a fall of twelve places compared with 2015. The average cost of debt is quite high and there has been minimal investment to date.

On Parameter III, Mozambique’s score was unchanged on the previous year, but fell four places to 34<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries. There are value chains in the solar, biofuels and small hydro sectors. 

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country ranked 50<sup>th</sup> scoring best on the Clean Development Mechanism risk indicator.
