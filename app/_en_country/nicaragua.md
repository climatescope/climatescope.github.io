#### Score Summary

Nicaragua scored 1.44 in Climatescope 2016, an increase of 0.30 on the previous year. The country climbed four places to rank 23rd overall and its best performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

It placed 15th on Enabling Framework Parameter I with a score of 1.67, which was a modest improvement. This reflected its supportive power sector structure, for instance its liberalised retail power market, and policies such as clean energy tax incentives.

Nicaragua jumped thirteen places to 13th on Parameter II thanks to high levels of investment ($856m) since 2011. The average cost of debt at 12.05% was also moderately supportive.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country scored 0.97, unchanged from the year before, and was placed near the bottom of the order in 46th. A lack of service providers and financial institutions dampened its performance. 

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Nicaragua placed 31st. While it demonstrated some carbon offsetting activity, its score was limited by a lack of carbon policies.
