Nicaragua has a diversified renewable matrix. In 2016, 47% of the 4.7TWh generated in the country came from biomass, geothermal, solar, small hydro and wind. Fossil fuel plants were still Nicaragua’s main source of electricity and were responsible for 52% of total generation in that year. Large hydro accounted for the remaining 1%. 

Renewable energy developers enjoy a full range of tax breaks, including import duty, VAT and income tax exemptions. Distributors must allocate a percentage to renewable power in tenders for electricity.

In January 2017, Nicaragua’s Ministry of Energy and Mines updated the Plan for Electric Generation Expansion 2016-2030 with a non-binding 73% renewable energy generation target by 2030. The plan also establishes interim renewables goals of 55% by 2018 and 64% by 2023. Large hydro qualifies toward goal attainment. 

Nicaragua’s high average retail electricity prices ($0.22/kWh) are largely due to its dependency on imported fossil fuels for generation. Renewable energy development is key to improving energy security and reducing generation costs. 

Electricity generation can be contracted through bilateral contracts between generators and distributors and/or large consumers. The Instituto Nicaragüense de Energía (INE) regulates transmission and distribution tariffs, while generators may compete freely in the market. The Comité Nacional de Despacho de Carga (CNDC) is Nicaragua’s electricity market operator, while the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) oversees energy policy and planning.

Law 532 is Nicaragua’s main policy supporting renewable development. It mandates set-asides for renewable energy in tenders. Sectors given priority are biomass, geothermal, hydro, wind and solar. 

INE is responsible for defining the percentage allocated for renewables in tenders based on MEM’s strategic expansion plan. Generators that do not have contracts with distributors or large consumers may sell their power in the spot market, where they can receive a price determined by near-term supply and demand conditions. The law also offers a variety of tax incentives for renewable projects. In addition to national exemptions, developers receive a reduction on municipal taxes.

Since 2015, the government establishes reference prices for renewable energy technologies in order to improve the competitiveness of clean energy sources in the country. In June 2017, the reference prices were updated, the maximum price for solar projects was reduced from $118/MWh to $70/MWh. Reference prices also apply to biomass ($80/MWh), geothermal ($92/MWh), hydro ($107/MWh) and wind projects ($80/MWh).


###Score summary

Nicaragua scored 1.44 in Climatescope 2016, an increase of 0.30 on the previous year. The country climbed four places to rank 23<sup>rd</sup> overall and its best performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

It placed 15<sup>th</sup> on Enabling Framework Parameter I with a score of 1.67, which was a modest improvement. This reflected its supportive power sector structure, for instance its liberalised retail power market, and policies such as clean energy tax incentives.

Nicaragua jumped thirteen places to 13<sup>th</sup> on Parameter II thanks to high levels of investment ($856m) since 2011. The average cost of debt at 12.05% was also moderately supportive.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country scored 0.97, unchanged from the year before, and was placed near the bottom of the order in 46<sup>th</sup>. A lack of service providers and financial institutions dampened its performance. 

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Nicaragua placed 31<sup>st</sup>. While it demonstrated some carbon offsetting activity, its score was limited by a lack of carbon policies.
