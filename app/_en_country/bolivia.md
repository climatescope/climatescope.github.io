Renewables represent a significant portion of Bolivia’s 2.4GW generation base. Fourteen percent of its installed capacity comes from biomass, small hydro, solar and wind. In 2014, the country published Decree 2048 to encourage clean energy development and increase participation in the country’s matrix.

As a natural gas producer, Bolivia has a major reliance on this fuel for power generation. In 2015, 57% of all the 9TWh generated came from gas plants. Hydro plants are the second main source of electricity and accounted for 27% of the electricity generated in that year.

In 2015, the country’s first solar plant was commissioned, a 5MW PV project located in Pando department. Additionally, 100MW from two more PV plants is expected to be online by the end of 2017. Those projects are located in Oruro and Potosi departments and have secured, respectively, $95.7m and $94.6m of finance for construction. Bolivia’s first wind farm, Qollpana phase I (3MW) was commissioned in 2014. Its second phase (24MW) has secured finance and is expected to be online by the end of 2016.

The country’s power sector is mostly served by state-owned company Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE). Through its 11 subsidiaries, ENDE is responsible for most generation, transmission and distribution in the system. Electricity prices have increased in the past years, although rates remain low compared to other countries in Latin America. In 2014, the average retail electricity price was $0.11/kWh.

Bolivia has a low electrification rate when compared to other Latin America countries. Around 87% of Bolivians have access to the grid, with high rates in urban areas (around 97%), and low rates in rural areas (around 67%). This amount is expected to rise due to the government’s “Electricidad para Vivir con Dignidad” (Electricity for Life with Dignity) program, which focuses on extending the grid and installing solar photovoltaic systems, wind systems and hybrid systems in low-income municipalities across the country. The program aims to achieve 100% of national electrification rate by 2025.

In October 2015, the government of Bolivia submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations, committing to increase its renewable energy installed capacity (including large hydro) to 79% by 2030. The target is in line with country’s National Development Plan 2016 – 2020, which sets a range of goals to be achieved over the next years. According to the plan, by 2020 Bolivia will add 3GW of capacity to the country matrix, 1.5GW from hydro plants, 1.1GW from combined cycle gas plants and 0.4GW from wind, biomass, geothermal and solar plants.
