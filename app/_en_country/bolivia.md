#### Score Summary

Bolivia scored 0.89 in Climatescope 2016 and dropped sixteen places to 45th on the list of 58 countries surveyed. Its score in 2015 was 1.04. One specific area of weakness was the country’s performance on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

It did well on Enabling Framework Parameter I as its score increased sharply and it gained three places to 45th. This was thanks, in part, to improvements in various structural aspects of its power sector. It did not perform well on clean energy policy, however.

The country’s score plummeted on Parameter II, sending it from second place globally to 33rd, a reflection of the sharp contrast between investment of more than $100m in 2015 and zero in the latest survey.

With only a small handful of clean energy companies in the country, Bolivia scored poorly on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III and was ranked 52nd.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country placed 35th. While it was relatively strong on the Carbon Offsets category, it had no carbon policies in place.
