Renewables represent a significant portion of Bolivia’s 2.4GW generation base. Fourteen percent of its installed capacity comes from biomass, small hydro, solar and wind. In 2014, the country published Decree 2048 to encourage clean energy development.

As a natural gas producer, Bolivia relies on the fuel for a large part of its power generation. In 2015, 57% of the 9TWh generated came from gas plants. Hydro plants were the second largest source and accounted for 27% of all electricity generated in that year.

In 2015, the country’s first solar plant was commissioned, a 5MW PV project located in the Pando Department. An additional 100MW from two PV plants is expected to come online by the end of 2017. Those projects are located in the Oruro and Potosi departments and have secured, respectively, $95.7m and $94.6m of finance for construction. Bolivia’s first wind farm, Qollpana Phase I (3MW) was commissioned in 2014. Its second phase (24MW) has secured finance and is expected to come online by the end of 2016.

The country’s power sector is mostly served by state-owned company Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE). Through its 11 subsidiaries, ENDE is responsible for most generation, transmission and distribution in the system. Electricity prices have increased in recent years, although rates remain low compared with other countries in Latin America. In 2014, the average retail electricity price was $0.11/kWh.

Bolivia has a low electrification rate compared with other Latin America countries. Around 87% of Bolivians have access to the grid, with higher rates in urban areas (around 97%), and lower rates in rural areas (around 67%). This amount is expected to rise thanks to the government’s Electricidad para Vivir con Dignidad (Electricity for Life with Dignity) programme, which focuses on extending the grid and installing solar photovoltaic systems, wind systems and hybrid systems in low-income municipalities across the country. The programme aims to achieve a 100% national electrification rate by 2025.

In October 2015, the government submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations, in which it committed to increasing installed renewable energy capacity (including large hydro) to 79% by 2030. The target is in line with country’s National Development Plan 2016 – 2020, which aims to add 3GW of capacity by 2020 – 1.5GW from hydro plants, 1.1GW from combined cycle gas plants and 0.4GW from wind, biomass, geothermal and solar plants.


###Score summary

Bolivia scored 0.89 in Climatescope 2016 and dropped sixteen places to 45<sup>th</sup> on the list of 58 countries surveyed. Its score in 2015 was 1.04. One specific area of weakness was the country’s performance on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

It did well on Enabling Framework Parameter I as its score increased sharply and it gained three places to 45<sup>th</sup>. This was thanks, in part, to improvements in various structural aspects of its power sector. It did not perform well on clean energy policy, however.

The country’s score plummeted on Parameter II, sending it from second place globally to 33<sup>rd</sup>, a reflection of the sharp contrast between investment of more than $100m in 2015 and zero in the latest survey.

With only a small handful of clean energy companies in the country, Bolivia scored poorly on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III and was ranked 52<sup>nd</sup>.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country placed 35<sup>th</sup>. While it was relatively strong on the Carbon Offsets category, it had no carbon policies in place.
