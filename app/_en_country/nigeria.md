#### Score Summary

Nigeria scored 1.34 in Climatescope 2016 and ranked 30th on the list of countries overall. This was a descent of eighteen places and largely reflected the country’s low score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, which plummeted in the absence of new investment.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country’s score fell slightly and the country dropped twelve places in the ranking. Nevertheless, the Policy and Regulation category saw some modest improvements, for instance in its tax regime and distributed energy framework.

In a reversal of the scenario in the previous year, Nigeria’s score on Parameter II tumbled to less than a quarter of its 2015 tally as new investment failed to materialise. It dropped forty-four places to rank 51st out of the 58 nations surveyed for Climatescope 2016.

The country score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III remained unchanged, ranking 13th and fourth amongst African nations.

Nigeria’s only positive performance was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. It climbed seven places to 24th thanks to improved scores in the Corporate Awareness category.
