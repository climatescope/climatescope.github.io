###Score summary

Ethiopia scored 1.29 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 32<sup>nd</sup> overall, a drop of six places compared with the previous year. The country’s best performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, it slipped three places to 33<sup>rd</sup> despite achieving a slightly higher score than in 2015. This reflected a relatively robust set of energy access policies, including a well-funded rural electrification programme, and off-grid financing facilities.

Ethiopia’s score on Parameter II jumped to 0.94 from 0.53 in 2015, elevating the country seven places to 18<sup>th</sup>. This reflected an increase in clean energy investment to $108m from almost zero. The relatively low average cost of debt was another positive factor.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country fell six places to 22<sup>nd</sup> owing to a slight decline in the number of value chains with active companies.

The introduction of an emissions reduction target produced an improvement in its score on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. However, this was not sufficient to maintain its ranking and it slid eight places to 43<sup>rd</sup>.
