Over the last ten years, the economy of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has grown at an annual rate of 6.5%. Despite this, and its rich endowment of natural resources, the country displays low development indicators with a gross national income of only $440 per capita. The civil war from 1997 to 2003 destroyed much of the country’s infrastructure.

Hydro accounts for 99% of the country’s generation capacity. We estimate current hydro installed capacity at 2,583MW, of which 1,113MW (43%) is out of service as a result of underinvestment. A project to develop an additional 4,800MW at the Inga 3 site is at the development stage, with support from institutions such as the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank. The country has about 100GW of hydropower potential, the highest in Africa.

The DRC contains only 4,600km of high-voltage transmission lines (above 110kV), and only 9% of the population has access to electricity. Households and businesses that are connected to the grid suffer from frequent power outages. SNEL, the vertically integrated, state-owned utility, has suffered from years of neglect and underinvestment. The utility’s losses amounted to $330m in 2014, about 1% of the country’s GDP. The average electricity tariff (at $0.048 per kWh) is the lowest amongst members of the South African Power Pool and well below SNEL’s costs. All of these result in financial losses equivalent to 4% of GDP. The World Bank-funded utility intervention into SNEL by contractor MHI has given better insight into SNEL’s challenges. The DRC recently approved a general tariff increase that increased tariffs for mining customers to 5.69 US cents per kWh and for R2 residential customers to 8.7 US cents per kWh, which has allowed SNEL to increase its collections to the level of $35-40 million per month. 

In 2011, the government adopted a five-year programme to reform the energy sector and improve the financial and operational performance of SNEL, which resulted in a management contract with Manitoba Hydro International in February 2015. The MHI contract has recently been extended into 2018.

The size of the country, the abundance of renewable resources (hydro, biomass, solar), the poor performance of SNEL and its limited reach, and the presence of large energy consumers (such as mining companies in rural areas) are all conditions that should favour the development of small and independent power producers and distributors. Over the last ten years a few pilot projects have started operations. Electricité du Congo has a local generation and distribution concession in Tshikapa, which includes a 1.5MW hydro plant and 10,000 customers. Virunga SA manages a 400kW hydro power plant and serves 27,000 people in Virunga. Independent power distributors apply tariffs that are significantly higher than the state-owned utility’s, reaching $0.20 to $0.30 per kWh.

The DRC’s Electricity Sector Law, adopted in June 2014, draws on these pilot projects, liberalizes the sector and aims at promoting private investment in all parts of the electricity value chain. However, the implementation of the law has been slow: although an independent regulator (ARE or Autorité de Régulation du secteur d’Electricité) was created by decree in April 2016, it is only expected to be fully operational mid-2017. So far, in the absence of an independent regulator that can promote competition, set tariffs and ensure grid access for third parties, the electricity-sector law has failed to attract significant private investment.
Similarly, the electrification agency (ANSER or Agence Nationale de l’Electrification et des Services Energétiques en Milieu Rural et Périurbain) charged with drawing up a plan to extend electricity access to the over 90% of the population currently living off-grid, has been created by decree but is not operational yet. This limits progress on electrification to isolated projects driven by loans from foreign foundations and multilateral development banks.

The DRC has no specific incentives for renewable energy projects. Imports of goods such as solar lanterns, and solar panels are subject to an import duty of 10%, an additional VAT of 16% and other import-related taxes. Overall, duties can amount to up to 40%. Exemptions on import duties and various taxes and levies can be obtained under the country’s investment code for a period of three to five years.


###Score summary

The DRC scored 0.74 in Climatescope 2016, an increase on the previous year. It placed 51<sup>st</sup>, overall and second last among the 19 African nations surveyed, above only Cote D’Ivoire. The country’s best performance by far was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the DRC ranked 53<sup>rd</sup>. This reflected, among other things, its unbundled power sector and the lack of a clean energy rural electrification programme.

It was also weak on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, taking 54<sup>th</sup> position. The clean energy sector has not attracted any investment since 2010, and the average cost of debt is high.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the DRC fell four places to 51<sup>st</sup>, highlighting weaknesses such as the absence of clean energy service providers. 

On Parameter IV, the country gained six places to rank 23<sup>rd</sup>, thanks to strength in the carbon-offsetting category and the establishment of organisations dedicated to building corporate awareness.
