Improving access to energy has a central role in Haiti’s new president Jovenel Moise’s program. A few months into office, Moise has abolished import duties on wind and solar generation products, as well as solar appliances. The government has adopted the Scaling-up Renewable Energy in Haiti plan (SREP), with the advice of the Climate Investment Fund, and is preparing its first renewable energy law. In terms of utility-scale power generation, grants and projects have focused on restructuring Haiti’s national power company Electricité d’Haiti (EDH). On a smaller scale, micro-grid projects are appearing across the island. 

Haiti has around 284MW of installed generating capacity, with the bulk (80%) derived from fossil-fuel plants. The remaining 20% comes from the Péligre hydro plant, which is undergoing restoration, and other small hydro plants. EDH owns 44% of generation capacity in Haiti and is responsible for transmission on the 1,500 km of distribution lines on the island. Today, given infrastructure limitations, EDH is able to power Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince and a few cities nearby, but only intermittently. Meanwhile, the use of diesel generators, kerosene lamps and other forms of off-grid technologies is commonplace. EDH has received grants from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and other international organizations to help the company improve its infrastructure.

The national grid shortfalls have created opportunities for distributed clean energy generation solutions and the implementation of micro-grids. With the help of a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Haiti’s first micro-grid started operation in the south of the country in 2015, providing solar power to around 450 households in the city of Les Anglais. The system relies on batteries to ensure reliability and smart meters for system stability and to facilitate pre-pay capability for customers. This micro-grid was partially destroyed after hurricane Matthew in late 2016. 20% of PV panels and all the cabling and polls were destroyed. EarthSpark plans to develop 80 other micro-grid projects.

The country does not have specific legislation mandating micro-grids, which slows down project developments and keeps risks high. Regardless, other micro-grids are appearing on the island. One, financed by IDB, the United Nations Environment Program and USAID, links the towns of Coteaux, Port-a-Piment and Roche-a-Bateau and is managed by a newly-created electrical cooperative. Another in Feyo Bien, is supported by IDB. Both micro-grids are powered by hybrid PV-diesel generators. Sigora Solar has also developed a diesel generator powered micro-grid in Moles Saint Nicolas, to which it will add solar generation shortly. 

While Haiti has limited energy related policies to date, the 2017-2018 Finance Act has abolished all import duty taxes on PV generation equipment, wind generation equipment, and solar powered off-grid home appliances such as fridges, lights, chargers. 

On September 30, 2015, Haiti submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations, in which it committed unconditionally to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 5% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario by 2030. This unconditional target represents a total emissions reduction of 10 million tons CO2e by 2030. The country also committed to a further reduction of GHG emissions by 26% below the BAU scenario by 2030, conditional upon international support. This represents a total reduction of 35.24 million tons CO2e by 2030.

###Score summary 

Haiti scored 0.78 in Climatescope 2016, an increase of 0.14 on the previous year. It ranked 49<sup>th</sup> overall, representing a drop of four compared with 2015. The country’s best performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

Haiti’s score on Enabling Framework Parameter I increased to 1.02 from 0.89, but it declined four places to 43<sup>rd</sup> position. The country’s relatively well-developed off-grid energy sector  contrasts with its almost total lack of clean energy policies.

Its score on Parameter II increased and it climbed one place to 44<sup>th</sup>. While there is no record of any investment in the sector between 2010 and 2015, the average cost of debt (at 12.92%) offered a degree of support.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country scored 1.32 (unchanged from 2015) and was placed 36<sup>th</sup>. The handful of distributed clean energy companies and service providers were the only bright spots in this category.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Haiti was just two from the bottom in 56<sup>th</sup> place, having minimal carbon offsetting activity and policies.
