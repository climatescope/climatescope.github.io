#### Score Summary 

Haiti scored 0.78 in Climatescope 2016, an increase of 0.14 on the previous year. It ranked 49th overall, representing a drop of four compared with 2015. The country’s best performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

Haiti’s score on Enabling Framework Parameter I increased to 1.02 from 0.89, but it declined four places to 43rd position. The country’s relatively well-developed off-grid energy sector  contrasts with its almost total lack of clean energy policies.

Its score on Parameter II increased and it climbed one place to 44th. While there is no record of any investment in the sector between 2010 and 2015, the average cost of debt (at 12.92%) offered a degree of support.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country scored 1.32 (unchanged from 2015) and was placed 36th. The handful of distributed clean energy companies and service providers were the only bright spots in this category.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Haiti was just two from the bottom in 56th place, having minimal carbon offsetting activity and policies.
