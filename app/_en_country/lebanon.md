###Score summary

Lebanon scored 1.02 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 40<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall. Its highest ranking was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country ranked 51<sup>st</sup> , reflecting its low power prices and small volume of clean energy generating capacity. It has energy generation targets and a policy on net metering, as well as debt/equity incentives.

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, Lebanon took 32<sup>nd</sup>  place, thanks chiefly to the relatively low average cost of debt at around 7%. There is no record of any clean energy investment between 2011 and 2015. 

Lebanon performed well on Parameter III – it ranked 26<sup>th</sup>  overall – thanks to the diversity of the sector’s value chains and the number of service providers. 

The country took 33<sup>rd</sup>  position on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. Its score was supported by a strong showing on the Clean Development Mechanism indicator and the presence of a GHG emissions reduction target.
