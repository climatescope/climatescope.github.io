#### Score Summary

Cameroon scored 1.13 in Climatescope 2016, ranking it 36<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, an increase of thirteen places. Most of the momentum for this increase came from a vastly improved performance on Enabling Framework Parameter I. 

The country leapt thirty-one places up the order on Parameter I to rank 16<sup>th</sup>. Its score benefited from a range of improvements in the Policy and Regulation category, including lower tax rates on solar equipment and measures to strengthen the framework governing distributed energy.

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, the country remained weak. It attracted no new investment and continues to endure a high average cost of debt. It was placed 47<sup>th</sup>, one spot down from the previous year. 

Cameroon substantially increased its score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III because of, among other things, a growing number of financial institutions operating in the clean energy sector. It climbed seven places to 42<sup>nd</sup>.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country sank one place to 38<sup>th</sup> overall. However, its score rose thanks to modest progress in the area of corporate awareness and the introduction of an emissions reduction target.
