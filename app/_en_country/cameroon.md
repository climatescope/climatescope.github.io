Cameroon is a politically stable sub-Saharan African country that has seen an average annual economic growth rate of 3.7% over the last decade. Its political stability stems from its powerful government, which is the main actor in all major power generation projects. Nevertheless, the energy sector was one of the first in Africa opened to privatisation and in 2015 it further unbundled with the creation of a national transmission and system operation company. However, the legal framework governing the electricity sector now needs significant review, which will likely take until 2018.

The country has a relatively weak electrification rate of 48% nationally and rural electrification remains low, at 24%. The government aims to increase electrification to 50% nationally by 2022, reaching 3GW of overall power capacity by 2020 in the process, mainly through the commissioning of new hydropower plants, and off-grid solar mini-grids in rural areas.

Effectively, Cameroon has the third largest hydropower potential on the continent (20GW) of which 732 MW has been developed, accounting for 58% of power generation (with a further 1,430MW planned). Thermal capacity accounts for the rest, including a 216MW gas power plant. As part of its nationally determined contribution (NDC), the government has committed to 25% electricity generation from renewable sources by 2035 but their development has been limited to date. The development of hydro resources is being prioritised, however, growing concerns over the impact of dry seasons on hydropower availability have resulted in the government considering alternatives including some demand-response in Douala (with 200MW of load reduction potential identified among steel and cement companies).

This renewable energy target is likely to be transcribed into law in the renewable energy law that is being drafted. The law will also likely mandate an auction or tendering process be implemented by the government, as well as set renewable electricity purchase tariffs and clarify the rules around purchase of renewable electricity. Currently, grid operators are obliged to buy excess production from renewable energy installations, though no price is specified and grid operators are also not allowed to buy electricity at above-market rates, causing conflict and rendering the policy ineffective. Consequently, the only effective support measure is that renewable energy equipment benefits from VAT exemptions. Other fiscal incentives are not well implemented in practice.

Cameroon was one of the first countries in Africa to open the energy sector to private investment. The Electricity Law of 1998 resulted in the entry of AES as a majority shareholder of Sonel, the national utility, in 2001. The company obtained a 20-year transmission and distribution concession and owns most of the existing generation capacity. In 2014 it was acquired by Actis, the private equity fund, and rebranded as Eneo. 
The law also made possible the involvement of independent power producers, which are legally allowed to sell power to clients with industrial loads. Two are currently active and operate the country’s two main thermal power plants: the gas plant at Kribi and the fuel oil plant at Dibamba. Independent power producers will also operate a solar plant expected to be commissioned in the next year, and a large hydro plant.

A new phase of reform in the power sector started in 2011, with the promulgation of a new Electricity Law which paves the way for unbundling generation, transmission and distribution. A December 2015 decree split out the transmission and system operation components of Eneo to create the state-owned SONATREL. By the end of 2017, Sonatrel is expected to take over the management of the transmission grid from Eneo, deciding on dispatch and acting as a single buyer for all grid-connected wholesale power generation. New concessions are expected be issued to SONATREL and Eneo by the end of the year.

Also under the law, a number of agencies were created in 2013, including the Rural Electrification Agency (AER) and the Electric Sector Regulation Agency (ARSEL) which sets electricity tariffs. The Electricity Development Corporation (EDC), was created in 2006 with the mandate to develop, own and operate hydro storage (but not power generation) assets. EDC now also manages water distribution (formerly under the responsibility of Eneo).

The 2011 law also opened the door to independent power generators and distributors in rural areas outside the concession of Eneo, but only one independent power generation and distribution license has been awarded: to GFDEE, a small company running a 0.6MW thermal power plant in Yoyo and serving about 160 customers. However, this project was developed outside of the regulator’s awareness together with the local population and ex-post granted an official concession. The Rural Electrification Master Plan, currently in its second phase, aims to electrify 10,000 locations by 2035, securing 50,000 connections per year for a 20 year period. The government is also preparing a new framework to govern the installation of private off-grid renewable energy projects, although it is unclear if this will be transcribed into national legislation, or rather simply serve as guidelines for prospective developers.

###Score summary

Cameroon scored 1.13 in Climatescope 2016, ranking it 36<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, an increase of thirteen places. Most of the momentum for this increase came from a vastly improved performance on Enabling Framework Parameter I. 

The country leapt thirty-one places up the order on Parameter I to rank 16<sup>th</sup>. Its score benefited from a range of improvements in the Policy and Regulation category, including lower tax rates on solar equipment and measures to strengthen the framework governing distributed energy.

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, the country remained weak. It attracted no new investment and continues to endure a high average cost of debt. It was placed 47<sup>th</sup>, one spot down from the previous year. 

Cameroon substantially increased its score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III because of, among other things, a growing number of financial institutions operating in the clean energy sector. It climbed seven places to 42<sup>nd</sup>.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country sank one place to 38<sup>th</sup> overall. However, its score rose thanks to modest progress in the area of corporate awareness and the introduction of an emissions reduction target.
