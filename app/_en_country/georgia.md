Georgia, a former Soviet Republic, is reforming its energy sector to comply with the standards of the European Union, and the EU Energy Community. That would mean more market-based pricing, energy efficiency and renewable action plans for the country nestled in the mountainous Caucasus region of Eurasia, bordering Russia to the north, and Turkey, Armenia, and Azerbaijan to the south. Overwhelming reliance on hydropower is the defining characteristic of Georgia’s energy sector. Electricity consumption is rising at a swift pace – 3.2% CAGR since 2006 – despite the two frozen conflict zones. The government hopes the healthy electricity demand, as well as transparency and competition, will allow it to attract the necessary investments to this sector.

Over 80% of Georgia’s electricity currently comes from hydro resources, and the government sees vast potential for further hydropower development. It is estimated that only 20% of Georgia’s total hydropower resource is currently utilized. Incentives have been introduced in the form of negotiated feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy, pre-selection of project sites for hydro power is on offer and a state-owned, renewable energy focused Georgian Energy Development Fund has been set up.

The country’s reliance on hydropower poses a challenge in maintaining seasonal resource adequacy. Peak electric demand in Georgia occurs in the winter when hydro reserves happen to be at their lowest levels. This is a major impetus behind the government’s support for three gas-fired generation assets, as well as the planned expansion of solar and wind power, from only one 20MW wind farm today, as well as the growth of international interconnection capacity. Georgia already has a high level of interconnection with its neighbors, mainly for resource adequacy, but it is also looking to export cheap, clean hydropower during the spring and summer months. Georgia looks westward especially, via Turkey, as it grows its energy markets with European integration in mind.
Nearly 100% of the Georgian population has access to electricity, which is procured through a mix of regulated direct contracts and a residual wholesale market, where only 12% of the total electricity generated passes. The current power market is changing under a brisk timeline – Georgia will begin deregulation of existing assets and have a new market structure in place by the end of the decade. Currently, the generators in the market are a mix of large regulated and small deregulated entities, totaling 40 individual generating companies. All units built post-2008, and under 13MW, are deregulated, but the rest (typically larger hydro units) operate under regulated-tariffs that are negotiated with the government.

Electricity is distributed and sold by three private, regional monopolies. The Georgian energy regulator (GNERC) introduced in November 2016 new direction on retail net metering: distributed generation is now paid the retail rate until a customer’s generation exceeds consumption on an annual basis, at which point customers are paid a wholesale rate for the excess. In 2016, residential retail rates averaged approximately 144 Georgian lari per megawatt hour, while spot wholesale priced averaged about 107 lari per megawatt hour.

Georgia’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC states that the country aims for a 15% emissions reduction below business-as-usual by 2030 (equivalent to a 34% reduction in emission intensity). The INDC covers energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture, and waste.


###Score summary

Georgia ranked 41st with a score of 1.11 on Climatescope 2017, the first year it has been included in the project. The mountainous former Soviet Republic relies on hydropower for around 80% of its power and is in the process of liberalising and unbundling the different segments of its power sector. It performed marginally better on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III than the three other parameters.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country was placed 34th overall. Its score is supported by the presence of a clean energy feed-in tariff, net metering and a renewable energy development fund. It is also supported by the ongoing deregulation of existing assets, development of a new market structure and the country’s 360MW of installed small hydro capacity.

Georgia took 33rd position on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, putting it in the top 50% of countries assessed. On the positive side, $23m of asset finance for wind projects was recorded in 2016 and a total of $139m (mainly in small hydro) since 2012. On the negative side, there are no loan and grant programmes.  

On Parameter III the country was 32nd. Its score was aided by the presence of banks and funds active in the clean energy sector, and a large variety of service providers, but undermined by the relatively small number of value chains represented by the country’s clean energy companies. 
Georgia was placed 33rd on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. It scored highly on the Nationally Determined Contribution, owing to its aim to reduce emissions across the economy by 15% below ‘business as usual’ by 2030, but was let down by the lack of a domestic climate change policy.
