#### Score Summary

Trinidad & Tobago scored 0.63 in Climatescope 2016, a slight improvement on its score of 0.57 the previous year. This placed it 55th overall, some seven places below its position in 2015. The country was among the bottom four countries on two out of four parameters. 

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country was ranked 57th, reflecting the absence of installed clean energy generating capacity and lack of any policies to encourage development.

Trinidad & Tobagoâ€™s best performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II. It was 38th on the list of 58 nations, thanks largely to its relatively low average cost of debt at just over 8%.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country was 47th. Nevertheless, there was a small handful of developers, engineers and service companies. 

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Trinidad & Tobago was ranked 54th. Owing to its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution it now has a GHG emissions reduction target.
