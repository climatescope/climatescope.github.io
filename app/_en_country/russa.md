Fossil fuels dominate Russia's power generation mix, accounting for about 60% of the country’s generation mix. This is unsurprising given that Russia is the largest producer of crude oil and has the largest natural gas reserves in the world. Russia is also the fourth-largest generator of nuclear power and the fifth-largest generator of large hydro power. At the end of 2016, Russia had an installed power capacity of 236GW.

Russia’s electricity market is broken into competitive 'price zones' where there are wholesale markets (including: European Russia, the Urals and Siberia); non-competitive areas where power is supplied at regulated rates (for example: the Far East); and isolated areas where there is no wholesale market (for example: Sakhalin). Now that the former vertically integrated monopolies have been unbundled and partly privatized, the challenge is to replace the aging power fleet and grid infrastructure, which will require significant investment.

Renewable energy accounts for less than 1% of Russia’s power generation, but the government aims to boost this share modestly via an auction program. The country plans to add about 6GW of wind, solar and small hydro to ensure renewable energy accounts for 2.5% of power generation by 2024. Russia also has a target to reduce energy intensity by 40% between 2007 and 2020.

The auction program grants fixed 15-year capacity payments to projects in order to top up their revenue from the sale of power in the wholesale market. Since 2013, five auction rounds have awarded about 4.3GW of capacity. The first three rounds saw bidders submit competing bids to secure 1,184MW of PV, 191MW of wind and 71MW of small hydro. The fourth auction, however, saw only a single bidder and winner: Rosatom, the state-run nuclear power agency that has been mandated with developing a Russian wind sector. Other developers boycotted the auction after the guaranteed internal rate of return for approved projects dropped by two percentage points. The fifth auction in June 2017 was more successful, awarding contracts for 2.2GW of renewables capacity. While partly state-run giants like Rusnano and Rosatom won again, foreign players such as Fortum and Enel also secured capacity.

One deterrent to additional renewable energy build has been the ambitious local content requirements, which have risen to 45% for small hydro, 65% for wind and 70% for solar. Another deterrent has been the weak ruble, though the government passed a decree to correct for exposure to currency volatility in 2015.

As part of its intended nationally determined contribution (INDC), Russia intends to limit greenhouse-gas emissions to 70-75% of 1990 levels by 2030, subject to the inclusion of forestry. However, as Russia’s emissions decreased dramatically after the collapse of the Soviet Union and have since remained below 70% of 1990 levels, Russia is on track to meet this target even if its emissions continue to grow. Russia’s climate actions are little more than political gestures, and the government is in no hurry to ratify the Paris Agreement.


###Score summary

Russia’s score of 1.22 on Climatescope 2017 – the first time it has been surveyed by the project – ranked it 34th worldwide, above the 11 other post-Soviet States. A period of reform has seen the country’s formerly vertically integrated utilities unbundled and partially privatised. It was strongest on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

In contrast, it was weakest on Enabling Framework Parameter I. Its score of 0.86 placed it 54th out of the 71 nations surveyed, partly a reflection of the lack of policies to encourage clean energy development, and partly due to slow growth of new capacity – just 187MW of renewable power has been added since 2010. Its score did draw some support from the ongoing reform of its power sector.

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, Russia took 46th position. The absence of investment in the sector between 2010 and 2016 was offset (to a small extent) by the somewhat favourable interest swap rate of 7.89%.

The country scored highly on Parameter III, securing seventh place globally. This performance reflects the wide range of value chains present in all renewable sectors (apart from geothermal) as well as the full suite of clean energy service providers. It also speaks of the wide range of financial institutions active in the sector.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country was placed 37th. Its Nationally Determined Contribution aims to limit anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to 70-75% of 1990 levels by 2030, which is only moderately ambitious considering its emissions are already below 1990 levels. The score was negatively impacted by the absence of a domestic clean energy policy.
