Jamaica seeks to decrease its oil dependency and improve its energy security by diversifying its electricity mix. It was the Caribbean’s first country to hold clean energy-only auctions. The country’s National Energy Plan 2009-2030 calls for 20% of its electricity generation to come from renewable sources by 2030.
Private utility Jamaica Public Service (JPS) has responsibility for generation, transmission and distribution on the island (the government owns 20% of the company). Other players may enter the market as independent power producers (IPPs) and sell electricity to JPS. 

The Ministry of Energy and Mining oversees energy planning and the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) regulates electricity. The OUR is also responsible for organizing and conducting tenders for power supply. Jamaica relies mostly on fossil-fueled generation using imported fuels, which is an expensive proposition for consumers. However, the average retail electricity rate in 2015 ($0.24/kWh) was 28% lower than in the 
previous year.

In 2015, 73% of Jamaica’s total 4.2TWh of electricity production came from oil and diesel plants. Renewable energy accounted for 6%. This mix is expected to change as a result of the contracts awarded in Jamaica’s renewable energy auction. Among the winners, two wind plants with combined capacity of 60MW and one 20MW PV plant were commissioned in 2016. A 37MW PV project located in the Westmoreland Parish is expected to be online by year-end 2018. 

Jamaica’s national energy policy encompasses five draft sub-policies: renewable energy, biofuels, energy 
efficiency, waste-to-energy and carbon credits trading. Each includes voluntary goals. 

Consumers with their own generation facilities may participate in JPS’s net metering pilot program. They receive an avoided-cost rate plus 15% for electricity delivered to the national grid. As of May 2015, a total of 118 consumers with renewable energy self-generation facilities were connected to the grid.

On November 27, 2015, the government of Jamaica submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations, in which it committed unconditionally to mitigate the equivalent of 1.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2030. This represents a reduction of 7.8% of emissions versus the business as usual (BAU) scenario by 2030. 

Jamaica also committed to a 10% below BAU target, subject to international support, especially for the expansion of its energy efficiency initiatives. Jamaica’s target covers only actions in the energy and transportation sectors, and its conditional goals are based on enhanced implementation of the National Energy Plan.
