#### Score Summary

Jamaica scored 1.41 in Climatescope 2016, a considerable improvement on the 0.81 it earned in the previous survey, and it climbed fifteen places to 24th. Much of the impetus for its buoyant performance was derived from a strong result in Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

The countryâ€™s score on Enabling Framework Parameter I was 1.19, a modest improvement on the year before. It was placed in the bottom half of the order (36th), highlighting the fact that there were no new capacity additions in 2015.

Jamaica took 3rd place globally on Parameter II with a score of 2.03. The jump from 40th in 2015 was fuelled by $208m of investment, there having been almost zero new funds in the previous four years. 

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country scored 0.78, which was unchanged from the previous year and put it 49th place. A scattering of project developers and engineers were present in the island nation. 

Jamaica ranked 40th on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV with a score of 1.37 that was hampered by a lack of clean energy policies, but buoyed up by its Clean Development Mechanism activities.
