#### Score Summary

Barbados scored 0.94 in Climatescope 2016, a marked increase on the previous year. It gained one place to rank 43rd on the list of countries overall, but jumped eleven  notches on Enabling Framework Parameter I.

Its score on Parameter I increased to 1.20 in the current survey from 0.74 in 2015, putting it in 35th place. Low import duties on clean energy goods and tax incentives were among the positive factors, while a fall in the islandâ€™s average retail electricity prices was negative.

Barbados also ranked  36th  on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, unchanged from 2015. Its relatively low average cost of debt (8.06%) helped to support this score.

The Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III score was marginally higher, but the country dropped 3 positions to 44th. The availability of corporate finance was one positive factor.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Barbados placed 48th, a weak performance that reflected its lack of carbon-offsetting activity, among other issues.
