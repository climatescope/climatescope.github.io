Rwanda’s score increased to 1.73 in Climatescope 2016 (up from 1.41 in 2015) as it made gains on all parameters, apart from Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II. The country ascended four places to 13th position overall.

The country was strongest on Enabling Framework Parameter I, where it placed second globally, just behind Uruguay. This reflected its well-developed distributed energy framework and improvements in the structure of its power sector.

On Parameter II, Rwanda’s score fell and it dropped fourteen places to 29th as no new investment was recorded in 2015. 

The presence of financial institutions, including venture capital and private equity clean energy investors, boosted the country’s score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III. It gained nine places to rank 17th.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country climbed fifteen places to rank 27th thanks to the presence of a number of corporate awareness initiatives as well as the World Bank’s Partnership for Market Readiness programme.
