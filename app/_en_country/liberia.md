#### Score Summary

Liberia scored 1.33 in Climatescope 2016 and ascended four places on the list of countries overall to 31st position. Its latest score – identical to its 2014 tally – was bolstered by a strong performance on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country’s score dropped by a small amount following a slight deterioration on two indicators – its policy on access to energy and regulation of distributed energy. It plummeted 16 places in the ranking to 28th.

On Parameter II, Liberia’s score shot up fourfold, propelling the country twenty-four places up the order to 7th position. This reflected a marked improvement on the loans and grants indicator, rather than new investment in clean energy projects.

Liberia ranked 43rd overall on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III. Despite a modest increase in its score, thanks to the emergence of the sector’s first financial institution, the country dropped two places in 2016.

Similarly, on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, its score rose, but it edged down one place to a very poor 55th, above only Haiti, Myanmar and Suriname.
