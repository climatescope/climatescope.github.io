Liberia is still working to pick up the pieces of its power sector, after two civil wars from 1998 to 2003 destroyed the country’s pre-war installed on-grid capacity of 191MW. Currently, the West African nation has the lowest electrification rate (2%) and one of the highest energy tariffs ($0.39/kWh) in Sub-Saharan Africa. The pace of activity picked up after a new energy law was passed in October 2015, which aims to unbundle the country’s power sector, and open up the generation and distribution sector to external investments.

The current on-grid capacity in Liberia is 107MW – 66MW from the recently rehabilitated Mount Coffee hydroelectric dam, 38MW from three heavy fuel oil (HFO) plants, and 3MW from high speed diesel. Nearly 95% of the generation in the country is from off-grid, private diesel generators. By the end of 2017, the remaining 22MW of Mt. Coffee facility will be grid connected.

Liberia also has two power purchase agreements (PPA) in place with the Ivory Coast, at $0.14/kWh, through the West African Power Pool (WAPP) for 27.7MW and 8MW. These near-term additions will be essential for Liberia to hit its electrification goal of 35% nationwide and 70% in the capital of Monrovia by 2030.

The national utility, Liberian Electricity Corporation (LEC), still has a monopoly on generation, transmission and distribution, and was previously under the management of Manitoba Hydro under a long-term contract that expired in 2016. Currently, a tender process is underway for the awarding a new Management Services Contract to replace Manitoba Hydro. In the interim, Tetra Tech, a United States-based consulting, engineering, and technical services company, is overseeing the day-to-day management of the LEC until the new contract is awarded later in 2017.

The Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy currently acts as a regulator, but an independent body, the Electricity Regulatory Commission, is expected to be in place by the end of 2017, making it easier for independent power producers to enter the market. Off-taker risk is a major concern, as LEC suffers annual losses and is concurrently developing four major transmission projects to bring electricity to communities bordering Monrovia. Projects greater than $10m are eligible for tax breaks.

The few operating clean energy projects in Liberia include a 4MW small hydro project at Firestone’s rubber plantation, a 1MW small hydro project in Bong County, a 60kW hydro microgrid, two biomass plants totaling 96kW and a 24kW solar microgrid in Lofa County. These are all off-grid. The Rural Renewable Energy Agency (RREA) was created in 2010 to spur renewable growth in rural communities where building transmission lines will be difficult and not economically feasible. Liberia has strong solar irradiance and six major rivers that could provide abundant renewable power, but securing international finance has proven to be a challenge. The local population also has a limited willingness to pay for power. The US Overseas Private Investment Corp (OPIC) had invested in a 35MW biomass plant being developed by Buchanan Renewables, but the project was abandoned in 2013.

Liberia’s has outlined four mitigation scenarios in their Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). The scenarios target 30% renewable energy generation, improving energy efficiency by 20%, the use of biofuels in transportation as well as the development of a landfill gas plant in Monrovia by 2030. If successfully implemented, the country would see a 15% reduction in greenhouse gases. However, the ability to realize these reductions relies upon the international community providing adequate financial support, capacity building and the transferring of technologies.

#### Score Summary

Liberia scored 1.33 in Climatescope 2016 and ascended four places on the list of countries overall to 31<sup>st</sup> position. Its latest score – identical to its 2014 tally – was bolstered by a strong performance on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country’s score dropped by a small amount following a slight deterioration on two indicators – its policy on access to energy and regulation of distributed energy. It plummeted 16 places in the ranking to 28<sup>th</sup>.

On Parameter II, Liberia’s score shot up fourfold, propelling the country twenty-four places up the order to 7<sup>th</sup> position. This reflected a marked improvement on the loans and grants indicator, rather than new investment in clean energy projects.

Liberia ranked 43<sup>rd</sup> overall on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III. Despite a modest increase in its score, thanks to the emergence of the sector’s first financial institution, the country dropped two places in 2016.

Similarly, on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, its score rose, but it edged down one place to a very poor 55<sup>th</sup>, above only Haiti, Myanmar and Suriname.
