#### Score Summary

China scored 2.53 in Climatescope 2016 and was placed first on the list of 58 countries for the third consecutive year. Its score was better than its tally the year before, and considerably higher than that of Chile, which took second spot with a score of 2.36. China was ranked among the top three countries on all parameters except Enabling Framework Parameter I.

The countryâ€™s score on Parameter I improved thanks to its range of clean energy policies and the presence of a rural electrification programme. However, the fact that it placed 17th reflected a lack of policy support for off-grid power projects. 

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, China scored 2.19 and was ranked second globally, behind only Honduras. This represented a sharp improvement in its score, a reflection of the more than $114bn invested in 2015, up from approximately $90bn the year before.

As in the previous two years, China topped the rankings on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III with a perfect score of 5.00, considerably ahead of 2nd place India with 4.42. China has consistently invested heavily in its value chain segments.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, China scored 3.06 and took 3rd place globally, down from 1st in 2015. Carbon trading schemes are being rolled out in selected regions.
