Mongolia’s power market is a backwater seeking to transform itself into a major hub. Its 1.1 gigawatt grid is dominated by Soviet era coal CHP plants that are required for electricity just as much as for heating during the harsh Ulanbataar winters. The country has set itself a target to have 20% of its installed capacity be renewable by 2023. To date, it has reached 8%, after having installed several small hydro projects, the pioneering 50 megawatt Salkhit wind farm in 2013 and the first 10 megawatt PV plant in late 2016. 

Reaching its 2030 targets will only require several hundred megawatts of renewable capacity, or about 600 megawatts less than the project pipeline currently in development. The government is therefore trying to drum up support for its vision of the ‘Asian super-grid’, which would allow the nation to tap and export the 2,600 gigawatts of estimated renewable energy resource in its vast steppes and deserts. 

A limited domestic market is not the only problem clean energy developers in Mongolia face. Despite a relatively generous feed-in tariff and support for clean energy PPAs, bankability remains challenging. Since the power market was deregulated in 2001, generation, dispatching, transmission and distribution have been nominally separated. However, all entities but a single distribution company and the renewable IPPs remain government-owned and are not seen as bankable off-takers for commercial capital. All clean energy projects to date have been financed by development banks or development financing mechanisms. Indications that the government seeks to lower the feed-in tariffs and denominate them in domestic currency instead of U.S. dollars will not make finding commercial investors easier. 

Despite these challenges, the country’s renewables industry is accelerating. Two new wind farms totaling 100MW will enter construction in mid-2017, and several PV projects are being promoted and could reach financial close still this year. The country has attracted large international developers such as Japan’s Softbank or France’s Engie, which is pitching to build a pumped-hydro storage project at the depleted Boroo gold mine. The lack of flexible generation capacity is rapidly emerging as a constraint to further integration of renewables. The country’s CHP coal plants are hard to ramp up or down, not least because they are required to heat the nation’s citizens as much as to power their homes. Peaking capacity is currently imported from Russia and China during the day, while excess power is exported back at far lower tariffs at night. As a result, local developers expect to see a much larger contribution from solar, which can alleviate these peaks, unlike wind, which generates more power at night. The nation’s best hope for more flexible generation capacity is a hydro plant in the Eg River, but it is unlikely to be built as long as Russia continues to oppose it.

Modular solar power may also emerge in the medium term as a way to provide power to medium-sized mines in remote parts of the country. The mining sector is a significant driver of the economy. Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi mine is expected to have a load of more than 400MW when it reaches peak output after 2020. That is equivalent to more than a third of the country’s current load. A dedicated coal power plant is meant to supply that power, but the project has seen delays due to investors, who are often wary of building new coal plants, and concerns about high water consumption in the middle of the Gobi desert. 

Despite the heavy reliance on combined heat and power plants, local air pollution from coal-based heating and cooking in Ulanbataar’s ger districts has made the capital one of the most polluted cities in the world. The government and donors are studying plans to bolster the distribution grid and to expand electrical heating. If successful, this additional heating demand could almost double the nation’s power requirements.


###Score summary

Mongolia scored 1.38 in Climatescope 2017, the first year it has been included in the project. It took 21st place among the 71 countries assessed worldwide and sixth position among the project’s 17 Asian nations. Its strongest performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II. 

The country’s energy market was opened to private players in 2001, and yet all but a handful of renewable power producers and a distribution company remain in government hands. 

The country’s weakest performance was on Enabling Framework Parameter I. Although the government has set a clean energy target and established a system of feed-in tariffs, development has been slow (with just 159MW of mainly wind and small hydro capacity installed by the end of 2016), mainly due to concerns about the bankability of key entities. It was ranked 59th.

The country excelled on Parameter II, taking fifth place globally, behind only Bolivia, Senegal, China and Jordan. Its score of 1.99 reflected investment of $153m in new wind generating capacity in 2016 and the presence of local investors as well as loan and grant programmes.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, Mongolia was placed 27th worldwide. Its score was bolstered by the presence of 18 varieties of clean energy service providers, out of a possible 20, but undermined by the relatively small number of value chains and types of financial institution serving the sector.

The country was ranked 44th on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. A national climate change policy has been in place since 2011, but it is not supported by any climate change-related regulations or incentives. Its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution proposes cutting emissions by 14% by 2030 compared with ‘business as usual’. However, as of March 2017, it had not submitted a long-term strategy.
