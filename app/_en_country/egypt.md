This North African country has abundant renewables potential, particularly for solar and wind. But it can be a challenging market for developers and investors, and there is a question mark over government commitment to clean energy after the discovery of natural gas reserves. 

Egypt's generating capacity mix remains decidedly fossil-fuel-focused, with these technologies taking nearly a 90% share. Until recently, the government was working to avoid the regular blackouts seen in 2014, caused by ageing infrastructure and gas shortages. But power demand growth has slowed, probably temporarily, as it is forecast to have the highest power demand in the region by the mid-2020s, according to BNEF forecasts. As such, the country aims to double its capacity mix of some 34GW by 2020, and introduce coal and nuclear power. 

The government wants to secure a fifth of electricity consumption from renewables by 2022, with 12% from wind. Yet the country has only seen modest renewables build to date. The feed-in tariff for projects under 50MW aims to add 2.3GW of PV and 2GW of wind. The first phase was 50% oversubscribed but only three PV projects won support, amounting to 150MW. The reported reason was that international financing institutions refused to provide funding because the place of arbitration was Egypt. Phase 2 is now underway and – despite a reduction in the solar tariff – appears to be generating interest.

The tenders for engineering, procurement & construction contracts have been the most successful to date at deploying renewables capacity. The program, which is meant to secure 3.2GW of state-owned power plants, tends to offer low-cost funding from development financing institutions. In contrast, the tender scheme for build-own-operate contracts has been less successful, with repeated delays and changes in specifications. This program is meant to source another 1.2GW of renewables.

The final mechanism, with a goal of 920MW, enables private investors to sell power from their renewables projects directly to large consumers. However, this program as well as the net metering scheme have seen little-to-no uptake, principally because Egypt has some of the lowest electricity tariffs in the world. They are set to rise, however, as the government kicked off a tariff-reform program in 2014. Tariffs climbed a further 40% in November 2016 and another uptick is on the cards for 2H 2017. 

Another change on the horizon for the power market was initiated by the 2015 electricity law, which began a gradual market liberalization. At present, the state dominates the power market, with the EEHC owning more than 90% of each segment. Instead a new competitive market will be created based on bilateral contracts; and the offtaker (EETC) will have more autonomy by becoming an independent transmission system operator. We would expect this change to help spur renewables deployment but the process is on the slow side.

The big uncertainty over this renewables market at present is how political will is to be affected by the impending start of production from the giant Zohr natural gas field off Egypt's Mediterranean coast. The country is currently a net gas importer but this discovery could enable it to boost gas output by 50% by end-2018.

Egypt was one of the few countries without a quantitative emission target in its Nationally Determined Contribution. Instead its submission to the UN included a range of high-level mitigation and adaptation goals such as "Increased use of renewable energy". But it did not outline specific actions.

###Score summary

Egypt scored 0.97 in Climatescope 2016 and it took 42<sup>nd</sup> place on the list of countries overall. Its best performance was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country scored 1.03 and ranked 42<sup>nd</sup>. The presence of a clean energy rural electrification programme helped to support its score, as did its well-developed set of clean energy policies, including feed-in tariffs and net metering.

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, Egypt ranked 42<sup>nd</sup>. No new investment was recorded in 2015, yet some $330m has been committed since 2011. The average cost of debt is relatively low at 11.6%. 

The country placed 30<sup>th</sup> on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III. Its score of 1.46 reflected the relative diversity of its clean energy value chains, plus the presence of a number of companies servicing the sector, including financial institutions.

On Parameter IV, Egypt took 30<sup>th</sup> position. The country is engaged in some carbon off-setting activities and has put in place initiatives to boost corporate awareness.
