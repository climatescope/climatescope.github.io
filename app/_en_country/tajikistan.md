###Score summary

Tajikistan scored 0.67 in Climatescope 2016, a minor improvement on the previous year. It placed 53<sup>rd</sup> on the list of countries overall, seven places lower than in 2015. Its best performance by far was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

On Enabling Parameter I, the country’s score slid. Its weakness in this area – it ranked 56<sup>th</sup> out of 58 countries – reflects its unreformed state-owned power system, with minimal clean energy and distributed energy policies. 

Tajikistan also placed 56<sup>th</sup> on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II. Between 2011 and 2015, its clean energy sector did not attract any investment, and only a very small volume of loans and grants. The average cost of debt is very high at almost 26%.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country’s score fell and it lost eight places to take 54<sup>th</sup>. The only sector represented among the handful of value chains is small hydro. 

Tajikistan’s score more than doubled on Parameter IV and it rose seventeen places to rank 22<sup>nd</sup>. This was largely due to the introduction of an emission reduction target and market-based policies to deliver GHG mitigation.
