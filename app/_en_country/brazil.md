#### Score Summary

Brazil scored 2.29 in Climatescope 2016 to rank third overall on the list of countries. It slipped from second last year, when it scored 2.12. The country placed in the top five on all parameters, except for Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

The country’s score increased on Enabling Framework Parameter I, but it dropped to 5th place from 3rd. Its power sector structure has many positive aspects, although utility privatisation is not among them. It was also lauded for the level of installed clean energy capacity. 

On Parameter II, Brazil’s score increased and it moved up one place to 16th. Investment fell, but to a still-respectable level. The average cost of debt was a weakness however – at 44% it was among the highest in the world.
