#### Score Summary

Malawi scored 0.89 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 46th on the list of countries overall. This was a decline of thirteen places on the previous year and reflected a fall in its scores on both Enabling Framework Parameter I and Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

On Parameter I, the country tumbled twenty-two places to 44th position. This reflected the low level of installed clean energy capacity (just 25MW) and slower growth in demand for power. Malawi’s distributed energy framework is relatively robust.

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, the country was placed near the bottom of the list in 55th place, reflecting the absence of investment in the sector. 

Malawi’s score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III rose very slightly, and fell by just one place to 29th. There is a relatively large number of clean energy service providers present, but the sector is served by just one financial institution.

On Parameter IV, the country plummeted twenty-four places to 42nd, owing to a moderate deterioration in its performance on the carbon offsets indicator.
