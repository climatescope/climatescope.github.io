#### Score Summary

Kenya scored 2.01 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 10th on the list of countries overall, down four from 2015. Among the 19 African nations, it ranked 3<sup>rd</sup>, behind only South Africa and Uganda. Its best performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

The country saw a slight improvement in its score on Enabling Framework Parameter I, performing particularly well on the Distributed Energy Framework and Energy Access Policies indicators. It was also rewarded for the 691MW of installed clean energy capacity. Nevertheless, it slid six places to 11<sup>th</sup>.

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, Kenya’s score improved thanks to the relatively high volume ($484m) of investment in 2015. However, this was somewhat offset by the scarcity of loans and grants, and the high average cost of debt. The country fell one place to 14<sup>th</sup>. 

Kenya did well on Parameter III thanks to the large number of service providers and diversity of the sector’s value chains. Its score was marginally lower than in 2015 and its rank remained unchanged at 9<sup>th</sup> place. 

The country took 12<sup>th</sup> position on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, up four places from the previous year. Its score rose in 2016, reflecting an increase in carbon-offsetting activities and corporate awareness initiatives.
