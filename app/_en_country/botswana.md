###Score summary

Botswana scored 0.84 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 47<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, the same position it occupied in 2015. The country’s best performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country fell three places to rank 52<sup>th</sup>. In contrast, its score increased thanks to improvements in the area of policy and regulation, particularly the addition of a clean energy rural electrification programme.

The country slipped two places on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II to 37<sup>th</sup>. Again, this was despite garnering a higher score (reflecting a decline in the average cost of debt). To date, Botswana’s clean energy sector has not attracted any investment.
 
On Parameter III, Botswana placed 33<sup>rd</sup>, a gain of one place that reflected a slight increase in the number of distributed clean energy value chains.

There was a marked improvement in the country’s score on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV. This pulled Botswana up three places to 47<sup>th</sup> and was largely thanks to the introduction of a target to reduce greenhouse gases.
