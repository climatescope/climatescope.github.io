#### Score Summary

Zambia scored 1.07 in Climatescope 2016, a slight increase on the previous year and a reflection of an improved performance on Enabling Framework Parameter I. Overall, however, the country slid five places to 39th.

On Parameter I, Zambia’s score increased, thanks partly to improvements in its distributed clean energy framework and partly because of a better performance on the Barriers indicator, specifically the reduction in import duty.

The country’s score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II saw a modest increase. However, it dropped four places to 43rd, a ranking that reflects an absence of investment since 2011 and relatively high interest rates.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, Zambia’s score declined marginally and lost five places to rank 28th. The number of clean energy value chains present in the country fell slightly. 

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country’s score increased slightly thanks to the introduction of an emissions reduction target. It ranked 25th globally, three places lower than in 2015.
