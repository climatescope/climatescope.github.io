#### Score Summary

Cote D’Ivoire scored 0.71 in Climatescope 2016, which was identical to its performance the previous year, but insufficient to maintain its position amid rising standards in many of the nations surveyed. The country dropped 10 places to 52nd overall and lowest among the 19 African nations surveyed. 

The country dropped eighteen places to 47th, on Enabling Framework Parameter I, reflecting slower growth in demand for power among other factors. Set against this, lower taxes on clean energy goods boosted the country’s Barriers indicator.
 
Cote D’Ivoire was placed last among the 58 nations on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, reflecting the very low level of investment to date.

The country ranked 38th on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, one place lower than last year. However, the presence of a number of clean energy value chains and service providers helped to prop up its score.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, the country ranked a very poor 53rd 53rd overall, ahead of only Liberia among the African nations surveyed.
