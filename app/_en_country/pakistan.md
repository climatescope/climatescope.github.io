Pakistan is suffering from a considerable power deficit and is dependent on energy imports. Outages of 6 to 10 hours a common feature during the summer months and the country relies on foreign gas almost 40% of its generation. The government is hopping to support continued economic growth (5.3% GDP growth in 2016) by improving and diversifying power supply. The 5% of renewables in generation by 2030 target is expected to be increased to at least 15% in the near future.

Pakistan added 300MW of solar power, 244MW of wind, 85MW of biomass and 48MW of small hydro power plants in 2016 but renewables deployment is set to accelerate. Indeed, the country has a 1.1GW of wind, 557MW of solar PV and 578MW of biomass power plants in different stages of development. Pakistan’s energy sector has also received a boost from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $62 billion Chinese investment stimulus targeting infrastructure including energy announced in February 2016. The initiative targets 10.4GW of new generation capacity from solar, natural gas and coal projects. It will contributed to the government’s target of attracting foreign direct investment for 90% of renewables project finance. The government is also seeking to increase private sector participation in other segments of the energy sector and has been issuing licenses in transmission and distribution. Direct electricity sales between private power producers and large consumers were also permitted in 2014, in an attempt to provide generators an opportunity to circumvent distribution companies, many of which have suffered from financial challenges since 2010.

Pakistan’s energy sector received a further boost from the Asian Development Bank in November 2016 and June 2017, with $ 325 million and $ 300 million in loans approved. The first loan is target at connecting off-grid areas in the two provinces of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab und is part of the Access to Clean Energy Investment Program with France contributing $ 78.6 million for this program. The other loan is aimed at short-term power sector stabilization measures and to support its long term restructuring. The World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) will also cofinance subprograms within the Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program.

Activity in the renewables sector in Pakistan has been driven through the use of feed-in tariffs (FiTs) which have supported 1.4GW of projects as of 1Q 2017. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority has been reducing the FiTs for solar and wind on a yearly basis. The continued use of FiTs rather than auctions like in neighboring India was justified by regulators as a way to avoid slowing activity in the sector. However, in 2017, there were signs that Pakistan may soon be changing its approach and introduce auctions for solar and wind power, starting with the announcement of a benchmark tariff ($ 7.7 cents/kWh for 100% local financing and $ 6.75 cents/kWh for 100% foreign financing) for all future wind power projects in the country that will act as a price ceiling in upcoming auctions. This tariff is 20% lower than the prevailing FiTs and would set power purchasing agreements at aggressive prices for the region, if it succeeds in attracting developer interest.

The State Bank of Pakistan has also mandated commercial and development banks to provide project loans to renewable power plants ranging from 4kW to 50MW with fixed interest rates of 6% for between 10 and 12 years depending on the size. In a bid to promote the development of a rooftop solar market, the Pakistan government also introduced a net metering regulations on 1 September 2015 which allow all domestic, commercial and industrial owners of distributed solar and wind generation under 1MW to sell surplus electricity to the grid.

Pakistan ratified the Paris agreement on November 11, 2016 and also submitted its Intended National Determined Contributions (INDC) which states that the country intends to reduce its 2030 projected Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by up to 30%. This commitment is conditional of the provision of international grants to meet the total abatement cost which the country approximates at about $40 billion at current prices.

###Score summary

Pakistan scored 1.87 in Climatescope 2016, a slight increase on the previous survey. It was placed 12<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, one place higher than in 2015. Its best performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III. 

The country’s score on Parameter I increased and it gained three places in the order to rank 13<sup>th</sup>. This reflects a strong set of clean energy policies and extensive distributed clean energy regulatory framework, but also weaknesses in its power sector structure.

Pakistan also saw a marked improvement in its performance on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, largely thanks to the injection of $720m of new investment, which represented 66% of the total committed to the sector since 2011.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country’s score rose slightly and it was ranked 4<sup>th</sup>. A substantial number of clean energy value chains and service providers are present, as well as a range of financial institutions.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, its score rose thanks largely to increased Clean Development Mechanism activity, and an increase in initiatives targeting corporate awareness of energy issues. It was placed 29<sup>th</sup>.
