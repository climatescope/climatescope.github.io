###Score summary

Pakistan scored 1.87 in Climatescope 2016, a slight increase on the previous survey. It placed 12<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, one place higher than in 2015. Its best performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III. 

The country’s score on Parameter I increased and it gained three places in the order to rank 13<sup>th</sup>. This reflects a strong set of clean energy policies and extensive distributed clean energy regulatory framework, but also weaknesses in its power sector structure.

Pakistan also saw a marked improvement in its performance on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, largely thanks to the injection of $720m of new investment, which represented 66% of the total committed to the sector since 2011.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country’s score rose slightly and it was ranked 4<sup>th</sup>. A substantial number of clean energy value chains and service providers are present, as well as a range of financial institutions.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, its score rose thanks largely to increased Clean Development Mechanism activity, and an increase in initiatives targeting corporate awareness of energy issues. It was placed 29<sup>th</sup>.
