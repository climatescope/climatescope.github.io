###Score summary

Sri Lanka scored 1.38 in Climatescope 2016, a slight improvement on its score the previous year. Nevertheless, it dropped two places to 27<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall. Its strongest performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Sri Lanka’s score increased and it gained two places to rank 38<sup>th</sup>. The score was supported by its clean energy policies, such as net metering, but limited by the lack of a clean energy rural electrification programme and energy access policies.

Sri Lanka’s score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II fell and it dropped fourteen places down the order to rank 25<sup>th</sup>. This chiefly reflected the absence of any new investment, loans or grants in the sector in 2015. 

On Parameter III, the country’s score was marginally lower than in 2015, unchanged at 12<sup>th</sup> place. The relatively high number of value chains and service providers was offset by a lack of activity in the distributed energy sector.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Sri Lanka’s score increased sharply and it climbed seventeen  places to rank 28<sup>th</sup>. Its solid performance was largely due to the introduction of a raft of carbon policies, including a GHG emissions reduction target.
