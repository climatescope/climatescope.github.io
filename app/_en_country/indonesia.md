###Score summary 

Indonesia scored 1.69 in Climatescope 2016, a slight improvement on its score the previous year. It fell three places to 14<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall and its strongest performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Indonesia scored 1.31 and gained seven places to rank 30<sup>th</sup>. The score was supported by a number of clean energy policies, including feed-in tariffs, but weakened by the lack of utility unbundling and absence of a wholesale power market.

Indonesia’s score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II fell slightly, and it slid twenty-four places, a clear reflection of the the volume of new investment ($308m) represented just 7.4% of total investment in the sector since 2011.
 
On Parameter III, the country’s score increased and it climbed two places to take the 6<sup>th</sup> spot. Its solid performance reflected, among other things, the sector’s 26 value chains and 18 service providers. 

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Indonesia ranked 10<sup>th</sup>, unchanged from the previous year. Its solid performance was partly thanks to its carbon policies, including a GHG emissions reduction target.
