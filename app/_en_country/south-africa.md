Once the benchmark of success on the continent, the South African renewable energy sector is quickly stagnating as policy delays bring investment and build-out to grinding a halt. In recent years the South African energy sector has experienced contrasting fortunes. The successful implementation of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement (REIPPP) Programme has sat alongside the economically damaging effects of rolling blackouts brought on by the maintenance backlog of an ageing coal-fired power fleet. In November 2016, the government released the latest draft of the Integrated Resource Plan, which outlines the country’s electricity strategy to 2050. Under the plan, the country seeks to add 37GW of wind plants over 2021-50 and 18GW of PV, and reduce coal's share of capacity from three-quarters to a fifth over the same period. The plan must now be approved by the Cabinet.

Eskom, the national utility, generates about 95% of South Africa’s power and is the sole purchaser of electricity in the country. The state-owned company has had financial troubles, exacerbated by the general state of the South African economy, and in April 2017, Standard & Poor's cut its long-term country outlook to negative. Together with Fitch and Moody's, S&P has put Eskom on a negative outlook.

Rolling blackouts, known locally as 'load shedding', were commonplace in 2015, but have been a less frequent event more recently, thanks in part to the slowdown in power demand growth. Eskom hit the headlines for less positive reasons in late 2016, after the CEO Brian Molefe resigned following a report by the former public prosecutor. The 'state capture' report alleged that Molefe and other members of Eskom's board did not declare their close relationship with the Gupta family, who owns a mine that sells coal to the state-owned utility.

Independent power producers (IPPs) are beginning to carve out market share with renewable projects, principally due to the auction programme. However, the scheme ground to a halt in 2016, after Eskom refused to sign further power-purchase agreements until it received "guidance" from government. The Cabinet, Treasury, office of the President, and Department of Energy have since expressed their commitment to the programme, as developers deal with the growing delays to their projects. Nearly a year ago, the Round 4-4.5 projects were due to reach financial close and the government was expected to announce the winners for the 1.8GW 'expedited bidding' window. Projects in Round 4-4.5 continue to face delays as financial close is yet to be achieved.

Based on the draft IRP published in November 2016, gas is set to be South Africa's baseload technology of choice. Combined-cycle gas turbines will see more than double the volume of new build that was forecast in the previous base case. That said, gas is suffering from the same political delays as renewables. Meanwhile, the draft IRP suggests that coal will see the biggest decline in share of capacity, but the country is still planning to add 15GW by 2041. The government announced the winners of the first Round of its coal power procurement programme in October 2016. The playing field is still muddy for nuclear: the new plan suggests that the first new nuclear plant will only come online in 2037 – some 12 years later than projected in the 2013 IRP. However, Eskom has said it will continue its plans to add 9.6GW.

The biofuels blending mandate was supposed to come into force in October 2015, but as of December 2016 the government had not released the pricing or final position paper. Still, a regulatory framework is expected to be submitted at some stage during 2017 – the same timeframe as the carbon tax is expected to come into force. This is perhaps one of the more controversial policies in the country due to the large financial implications for Eskom and the mining sector.

South Africa is a signatory to the UNFCCC Paris Agreement and in its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) is based on an emission trajectory. It intends to target an emissions level in the range of 398 -614 MTCO2e including LULUCF and 417 – 633 MTCO2e excluding LULUCF over the 2025-30 period. This equates to a range of 20 -82% above 1990 emissions level. Despite this pledge, South Africa’s current policy framework puts it on an emissions trajectory that is estimated to be above this already significant range. 

###Score summary

South Africa scored 2.21 in Climatescope 2016, ranking it 5<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, one place lower than in 2015. Its highest finish was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, South Africa’s score suffered a fairly significant fall and the country dropped twenty-six places to rank 32<sup>nd</sup>. This was due to, among other things, slower growth in the rate of clean energy installation and generation.

In contrast, its score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II increased more than threefold and it climbed eighteen places to 6<sup>th</sup> thanks to more than $4bn of new investment in the sector in 2015.

South Africa’s score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III edged up slightly. It was ranked 3<sup>rd</sup> globally, a reflection of the number and variety of companies (including financial institutions) serving its clean energy sector.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, South Africa’s score rose sharply and it took the number one spot globally. It was very strong on all three categories – carbon offsets, carbon policy and carbon policy.
