#### Score Summary

South Africa scored 2.21 in Climatescope 2016, ranking it 5<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, one place lower than in 2015. Its highest finish was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, South Africa’s score suffered a fairly significant fall and the country dropped twenty-six places to rank 32<sup>nd</sup>. This was due to, among other things, slower growth in the rate of clean energy installation and generation.

In contrast, its score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II increased more than threefold and it climbed eighteen places to 6<sup>th</sup> thanks to more than $4bn of new investment in the sector in 2015.

South Africa’s score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III edged up slightly. It was ranked 3<sup>rd</sup> globally, a reflection of the number and variety of companies (including financial institutions) serving its clean energy sector.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, South Africa’s score rose sharply and it took the number one spot globally. It was very strong on all three categories – carbon offsets, carbon policy and carbon policy.
