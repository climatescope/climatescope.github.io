The energy fleet in Vietnam is composed primarily of large hydropower (38%), coal (34%) and natural gas (18%). Renewables contribute only a fraction of total installed capacity (43.3GW in 2016), with small hydropower (2.8GW) and other renewables making up 7% of capacity. Revised Power Development Plan aims to increase the share of renewables while simultaneously promoting new coal build and LNG import facilities to support a growing industrial sector. Electricity demand is expected to increase 9% annually from 141TWh in 2015 to 506TWh by 2030.

In March 2016, the Prime Minister approved the revised Power Development Plan VII for the period of 2016-2030, a follow up to the previous 2011 Power Development Plan. The new legislation puts a stronger emphasis on renewable growth, fuel diversification and transmission reliability. Most importantly, it increases the renewable generation target to 6.5% by 2020 (previously 4.5%) and to 10.7% by 2030 (previously 6%). It also adds technology specific targets for biomass and solar, in addition to previously set wind goals. The targets are: 800MW of wind by 2020 and 6GW by 2030; 850MW of PV by 2020 and 12GW by 2030; and 750MW of biomass by 2020 and 3.2GW by 2030. At the same time, the Plan calls for another 43GW of new coal to be built by 2030 and several new LNG import facilities.

Vietnam has a number of existing laws and incentives to support renewables. This includes a Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) of $0.078/kWh for wind, $0.0935/kWh for solar, $0.7/kWh for landfill waste, $0.10/kWh for incineration and $0.06/kWh for CHP biomass. Small hydro power and biomass are given avoided-cost-tariffs (AVCT) which refer to the cost saved by power system while procuring 1kWh of renewable power. These are revised annually based on the production cost of the most expensive power plant in the grid. Renewable projects can claim a preferential corporate income tax rate of 10% for 15 years, compared to 20% for other industries and accelerated depreciation on assets 1.5 – 2.5 times faster than other property.

Nonetheless, existing incentives have failed to boost the industry and development remains stagnant. FiTs for wind and biomass are insufficient to encourage new build. Power Purchase Agreements are not considered bankable by the private sector which poses difficulties in financing. As a result, to date only 160MW of wind have been built, small-hydro resources are becoming scarce and no major utility-scale PV has been commissioned. 

###Score summary

Vietnam scored 1.56 in Climatescope 2016, up from 1.28 in the previous survey. This improvement moved it five places up the order to 17<sup>th</sup> position on the list of countries overall. Its best performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Parameter I, the country’s score was almost unchanged, yet it fell five places to 40<sup>th</sup>. Clean energy policies, such as feed-in tariffs and an energy target supported the score, but the absence of a distributed energy framework was a weakness. 

Vietnam’s score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II more than doubled from last year and the country took 20<sup>th</sup> position in the ranking. 

On Parameter III, the country’s score increased and it was ranked 10<sup>th</sup> globally, up from 14<sup>th</sup> the year before. It has value chains in every clean energy sector, and four varieties of financial institutions serve the clean energy sector.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, its score increased in the Carbon Policy category, thanks to the introduction of a GHG emissions reduction target and a carbon tax. It was placed 14<sup>th</sup>.
