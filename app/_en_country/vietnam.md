###Score summary

Vietnam scored 1.56 in Climatescope 2016, up from 1.28 in the previous survey. This improvement moved it five places up the order to 17<sup>th</sup> position on the list of countries overall. Its best performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Parameter I, the country’s score was almost unchanged, yet it fell five places to 40<sup>th</sup>. Clean energy policies, such as feed-in tariffs and an energy target supported the score, but the absence of a distributed energy framework was a weakness.

On Parameter III, the country’s score increased and it was ranked 10<sup>th</sup> globally, up from 14th the year before. It has value chains in every clean energy sector, and four varieties of financial institutions serve the clean energy sector.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, its score increased in the Carbon Policy category, thanks to the introduction of a GHG emissions reduction target and a carbon tax. It was placed 14<sup>th</sup>.
