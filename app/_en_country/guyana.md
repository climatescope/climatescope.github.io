#### Score Summary 

Guyana scored 0.67 in Climatescope 2016, an increase of 0.13 on its tally in the 2015 survey. It took 54th place on the list of 58 countries, a decline of three from the previous year. The country performed relatively poorly on all four parameters, ranking between 46th and 58th on each.

Its score on Enabling Framework Parameter I increased to 1.00 from 0.78, but it slipped one place to 46th position. Its weakness stems from a lack of coherent clean energy policy and the absence of project development since 2010.

Guyana’s score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II fell slightly, and it dropped fourteen places to 48th. There is no record of any investment in the sector between 2010 and 2015. However, the average cost of debt (at 12.89%) did offer a small degree of support. 

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country’s score was unchanged at 0.07, which put it in 58th position. Guyana’s only clean energy company in 2015 was a biomass project developer.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, its score rose and yet it dropped six places to 46th. The presence of a GHG emissions reduction target was one of few positive attributes.
