With an electrification rate of 12% and an unreliable and inadequate installed capacity (133MW), Sierra Leone’s electricity sector is in need of investment and reform., the government is beginning to address the issue with a draft of the country’s first dedicated national renewable-energy policy.

Of the 133MW of installed capacity in Sierra Leone, 77MW comes from thermal sources while 56MW comes from small hydro—this means nearly half (42%) comes from clean sources. However, the country’s clean energy capacity has experienced difficulties. The country’s reliance on the 50MW Bumbuna Hydro project can lead to load shedding and blackouts during the dry season. In 2014, the 32MW Addax bioethanol plant was expected to begin injecting 15MW to the grid, however, it has yet to be grid connected.

The country’s grid only covers Freetown, the capital, and two other isolated areas (Bo – Kenema and Makeni systems). To improve the electrification rate and grid stability, the Ministry of Energy has drafted a national grid development plan to 2030, which includes integrating the WAPP (West African Power Pool) line running from Liberia in the South to Guinea in the North (international funding has been secured), the mining districts in the East and the existing three grid hubs. However, since domestic funding for the expansion is not available, there is scope for widespread adoption of distributed solar systems by citizens waiting for the grid.

Expansion of the on-grid capacity is slow and will require significant private sector investment, but in order to realize this the government needs to streamline the PPA application process. Iin its current state it is reported to take as long as four years. In addition, a lack of familiarity with clean energy projects, excessive interest rates (>23%), and lending in volatile local currency, means domestic debt facilities are unworkable for project developers.

The country is betting on a new hydro project—202MW Bumbuna Phase II – to fulfil the bulk of its capacity expansion plans and is hoping for a successful resolution of its PPA negotiations with the developer, Joule Africa. If Bumbuna Phase II goes ahead then commissioning is expected no earlier than 2021 at an estimated cost of around $445m. Grid-connected solar is expected to materialize in the next two years since the government signed PPAs with two different developers – Mubadala Development Co. and SolarEra. Mubadala has secured a PPA for a 6MW plant due in 2017, whereas SolarEra has signed a PPA for a 5MW in 2017 and 20MW due in 2018.

Since its separation from the national utility in 2015, EDSA (Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority) has improved its revenue collection by transitioning from post to pre-paid meters. Current penetration is estimated at around 50-70% of customers. This is particularly welcome news for investors considering the off-taker risk and creditworthiness of PPAs for proposed clean energy projects in the country.


#### Score Summary

Sierra Leone scored 1.35 in Climatescope 2016, which was sharply higher than in 2015. It placed 28<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, and its best performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Sierra Leone’s score rose slightly thanks to growth in installed capacity and the introduction of a number of energy access policies. However, this was not enough to prevent it from dropping down six places to 34<sup>th</sup> position.

The country was strong on Parameter II – its score rose threefold and it climbed nineteen places to rank 8<sup>th</sup> overall. This reflected the comparatively high level of investment ($382m) between 2011 and 2015.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country maintained the same score as in 2015. This was supported by the presence of value chains in the biomass, biofuels and small hydro sectors.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Sierra Leone’s score jumped from 0.27 to 1.39, partly owing to the introduction of new carbon policies and increased carbon-offsetting activity.
