Improvements in the national electrification rate of Sierra Leone have failed to live up to the ambitions of either the public or private sector, with urban electricity access sitting at 12.5% and rural access at just 2% for 2016. On-grid generation is both inadequate and unreliable: installed capacity is just 137.2MW and blackouts are common. Plans are in place to increase capacity and step up the availability off-grid systems to rural areas through the National Electricity Act, the Energy Strategic Plan and the National Renewable Energy Policy, ratified in 2017.

The national health crisis caused by Ebola in 2015 largely accounts for the slow progress of the energy sector over the last few years as funding and administrative resources were diverted to contain the outbreak. With that most pressing concern under control, the government has had more room to focus on energy and education, both of which are key to unlocking further funding from U.S. and European development agencies.
Of the country’s 137.2MW of capacity, 77MW comes from thermal sources and 60.2MW comes from hydro—this means nearly half (42%) comes from clean sources. However, the country’s clean energy capacity has experienced difficulties. Sierra Leone’s reliance on the 50MW Bumbuna Hydro project can lead to load shedding and blackouts during the dry season. The Addax bioethanol plant has experienced major difficulties with the target capacity of 32MW being lowered several times before the power generation portion of the project was suspended completely in 2016. The plant battled problems connecting to the grid and acquiring appropriate volumes of the highly seasonal sugar cane feedstock.

The country’s grid only covers Freetown, the capital, and two other isolated areas (Bo – Kenema and Makeni systems). To improve the electrification rate and grid stability, the Ministry of Energy has drafted a national grid development plan to 2030, which includes integrating the WAPP (West African Power Pool) line running from Liberia in the South to Guinea in the North (international funding has been secured), the mining districts in the East and the existing three grid hubs. However, since domestic funding for the expansion is not available, there is scope for widespread adoption of distributed solar systems by citizens waiting for the grid.

The government’s appreciation of the need for both on-grid and off-grid solutions has led to two different and aggressive energy targets. On-grid: the government is aiming for 1,000MW of capacity by 2018 (including projects that have closed financing). The looming 2018 national elections have provided some much needed impetus for this target, but it is still unlikely to be achieved. Expansion of the on-grid capacity is slow and will require significant private sector investment. In order to realize this, the government needs to streamline the PPA application process as large projects have taken up to six years to be secured. In addition, a lack of will (due to unfamiliarity with clean energy projects), excessive interest rates (>23%) and lending in volatile local currency has meant domestic debt facilities are unworkable for project developers.

As for off-grid, the government fell short of the 50,000 solar units targeted in 2016. However, early numbers in 2017 indicate this year’s target of 200,000 units could be achieved. To garner the private sector’s help in achieving the off-grid target, the government has waivered duty and VAT on imported quality-certified products (using international standards). By incentivizing the roll-out of quality products, the government is hoping the reputation and promise of improved economics and benefits of off-grid solutions are upheld.

The country is betting on several new IPP hydro projects and thermal projects to fulfil the bulk of its capacity expansion plans to 2030. The 130MW Joule Africa Bumbuna Phase II (hydro) and the 57MW Copperbelt Energy (thermal) projects nearing financial close will be part of this. If Bumbuna Phase II goes ahead, then commissioning can be expected no earlier than 2021 at an estimated cost of around $675 million. The Bankasoka (2.2MW) and Charlotte (2MW) small hydro projects have been completed by Hunan Group and handed over to the EGTC (Electricity Generation and Transmission Corp.). Grid-connected solar is optimistically expected to materialize in 2017 since the government signed PPAs with two different developers – Infinity-E and SolarEra. The first has secured a PPA for a 6MW plant due in early 2018, whereas SolarEra has signed a PPA for 5MW in 2017 and 20MW (solar and diesel hybrid) due in late 2018. The Infinity-E project was funded by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, but the financing for SolarEra’s projects is yet to be secured despite a PPA signed in 2015.

Since its separation from the national utility in 2015, EDSA (Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority) has improved its revenue collection by transitioning from post to pre-paid meters. Current penetration is estimated at around 85% of customers. This is particularly welcome news for investors considering the off-taker risk and creditworthiness of PPAs for proposed clean energy projects in the country.

#### Score Summary

Sierra Leone scored 1.35 in Climatescope 2016, which was significantly higher than in 2015. It placed 28<sup>th</sup> on the list of countries overall, and its best performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Sierra Leone’s score rose slightly thanks to growth in installed capacity and the introduction of a number of energy access policies. However, this was not enough to prevent it from dropping down six places to 34<sup>th</sup> position.

The country was strong on Parameter II – its score rose threefold and climbed nineteen places to rank 8<sup>th</sup> overall. This reflected the comparatively high level of investment ($382m) between 2011 and 2015.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, Sierra Leone maintained the same score as in 2015. This was supported by the presence of value chains in the biomass, biofuels and small hydro sectors.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Sierra Leone’s score jumped from 0.27 to 1.39, partly owing to the introduction of new carbon policies and increased carbon-offsetting activity.
