#### Score Summary

Sierra Leone scored 1.35 in Climatescope 2016, which was sharply higher than in 2015. It placed 28th on the list of countries overall, and its best performance was on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Sierra Leone’s score rose slightly thanks to growth in installed capacity and the introduction of a number of energy access policies. However, this was not enough to prevent it from dropping down six places to 34th position.

The country was strong on Parameter II – its score rose threefold and it climbed nineteen places to rank 8th overall. This reflected the comparatively high level of investment ($382m) between 2011 and 2015.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country maintained the same score as in 2015. This was supported by the presence of value chains in the biomass, biofuels and small hydro sectors.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Sierra Leone’s score jumped from 0.27 to 1.39, partly owing to the introduction of new carbon policies and increased carbon-offsetting activity.
