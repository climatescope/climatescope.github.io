Turkmenistan is abundant in natural gas and this serves as the cornerstone of its economy and the sole fuel for its 6.6GW power generation fleet. Cleaner energy remains a low priority due to cheap, relatively clean power generation and low - heavily subsidized – electricity prices. The current energy mix, the opaque legal system, centralized government and a state-controlled economy, leaves little incentive for foreign capital to invest in any non-hydrocarbon based industry. 

Land-locked and rich in natural gas, Turkmenistan’s economy, of which the private sector represents less than 25%, relies almost entirely on hydrocarbon exports. Its resource-based economy and centralized government has changed little since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Providing cheap power, fuel and water are closely tied to political stability.  

The power market is controlled by Turkmenenergo, the state-owned utility, under the purview of the Ministry of Energy. It is responsible for operation, generation, transmission and distribution (through local subsidiaries) of all grid- connected power plants (there are a number of off-grid projects serving large-scale industrial locations). The only private sector participation is during the construction phase, which is determined by non-public RFPs. 

Its 6.6GW power fleet is powered almost entirely by natural gas. According to the Ministry of Energy in its ‘Concept of Development of the Power Industry: 2013-2020’, the country has modest goals to increase capacity to over 8GW by 2020 with no plans to diversify technologies and fuels. The document also states plans to modernize the transmission grid and promote more efficient power plants.

While there are no explicit laws preventing the construction of renewables, they cannot compete with Turkmenenergo’s artificially low power prices. Cheap power is provided to industry to boost manufacturing and to agriculture to subsidize food prices. Residential prices are around $0.0008/ kWh, so low that most households get a $2-5 bill every six months to make postage cost-effective.
Domestic power demand has steadily increased 15% per annum in the last seven years and the government’s plan to fund the system, whilst keeping domestic prices low, is to grow revenue generation from power exports to Iran, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. 

On 29 September 2015, the government of Turkmenistan submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations, intending to hit peak carbon intensity (emissions per capita) by 2030.  No concrete policies or strategies have been implemented but the 'National Strategy of Turkmenistan for Climate Change', outlines a broad strategy, which promotes efficiency in buildings and power generations and sustainable growth of industry.
