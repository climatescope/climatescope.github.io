El Salvador’s National Energy Policy aims to diversify its power matrix and reduce its oil dependency by adding more renewable capacity. The country conducts technology-specific renewable energy tenders and offers income and import tax exemptions to clean energy projects.

With 1.8GW of installed capacity in 2016, oil, hydro and geothermal are El Salvador’s main sources of electricity. Out of the 5.5TWh produced that year, 43% came from oil-based generation, 24% from hydro and 27% from geothermal. The remaining power was generated by biomass and solar plants. The National Energy Council (Comisión Nacional de Energía) oversees the electricity sector in the country, while the Superintendencia General de Electricidad y Telecomunicaciones is the power sector regulator. State-owned Empresa Transmisora de El Salvador (ETESAL) is charged with transmission and Unidad de Transacciones regulates the wholesale power market and acts as the system operator. El Salvador is also part of the Central American Electrical Interconnected System and is connected to Guatemala and Honduras by 286km of transmission lines.

El Salvador’s power market has been unbundled and generation is open to private operators. Around 13 independent power producers are active. One of the largest generators in the country is LaGeo, which initially was a joint venture between Enel Green Power and El Salvador’s state-owned Inversiones Energeticas. After a long litigation process, El Salvador will acquire Enel Green Power’s stake in the project (36.2%) and will become the single owner of LaGeo.

Tenders have been introduced to replace expiring bilateral power agreements and encourage renewable energy contracts. The first auction for renewable capacity took place in 2014, and contracted 94MW of solar PV capacity. A 100MW solar plant, which signed a PPA for 60MW, was commissioned in May 2017. The other winners are expect to come online by end-year 2017. In January 2017, the country held one more auction and contracted 50MW of wind and 120MW of solar capacity for 20-year power purchase agreements. Solar projects are expected to be commissioned by April 2019 and wind plants by April 2020. 

Under decree 462 of 2007, El Salvador grants tax incentives for development of renewable energy sources, including 10 years of import tax exemption to machines and equipment, and income tax breaks for renewable energy projects. The sale of credits under the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) for renewable energy projects is not subject to income tax. Furthermore, ETESAL is required to guarantee priority dispatch to electricity generated from renewable sources.
