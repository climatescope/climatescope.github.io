Guatemala is the second largest Central American power market, with a total generating capacity of 3.7GW. In 2015, it generated 10.3TWh of electricity, 46% of which came from fossil-based generation. Large hydro is the next most important source, representing 26% of total power produced. Renewables (small hydro, biomass and geothermal) accounted for 29% of generation.

Guatemala holds auctions to award contracts for electric output and power, in which renewables may have either a specific quota or compete with other technologies. In addition, the country offers a range of tax incentives to clean energy projects, as set by Decree 52-2003. These include fiscal incentives for renewable projects and exempts generators from import, equipment, value-added and net income taxes for 10 years.
Net metering is also allowed in the country. As of 31 December 2015, 1,274 self-producers with a total installed capacity of 7.4MW were connected to the grid.

The power market in Guatemala is unbundled, with both state and private players acting in generation, transmission, energy trading and distribution segments. The Ministry of Energy and Mining oversees planning for the electricity sector, while the National Electricity Commission (Comisión Nacional de Energía Eléctrica, or CNEE) is in charge of regulation. Additionally, the Wholesale Market Operator (Administrador del Mercado Mayorista) organises the system’s dispatch based on marginal cost of generation.

Guatemala is connected via the Central American Electrical Integration System (SIEPAC) to Honduras and El Salvador. In 2015, the country exported 843GWh via SIEPAC. This figure represents over 60% the total electricity exported in the system. Northern Guatemala is also connected to Mexico’s transmission system.

Since 2012, CNEE has held tenders to contract power capacity. Distribution companies are the offtakers. The first tender awarded a total of 393MW to small hydro (221MW), wind (101MW), solar (55MW) and biomass (16MW) plants under 15-year power purchase agreements. A second tender, in 2014, aimed to contract 250MW, open to all technologies. The auction contracted 322MW. This time, wind projects did not secure any contracts, as projects were not competitive enough, but other renewables (solar, biomass and small hydro) were awarded 116MW.

The auctions have been the main driver for renewable energy investment in the country, resulting in a record year for clean energy committed funds: in 2014, a total of $702m was invested in biomass, solar, small hydro and wind plants. Investments decreased sharply in 2015, when only the solar sector received a total of $66m.

In 2015, the first auctioned projects started to come online. The country’s first wind farm, of 53MW, was commissioned in April, and a 23MW wind farm came online in December. Additionally, two large-scale PV plants (30MW and 50MW) and four hydro plants (totalling 40MW) were commissioned, increasing the country’s renewable share.

Guatemala’s renewable energy installed capacity increased 38%, reaching 1GW in December 2015. The country’s average retail electricity prices fell 21%, from $228/MWh in 2014 to $181/MWh in 2015.


###Score summary

Guatemala scored 1.49 in Climatescope 2016, an increase of 0.09 on its total the year before. It placed 21<sup>st</sup> overall, down three from its position in the previous survey. The country’s strongest performance by far was on Enabling Framework Parameter I.

Its score on Parameter I increased to 2.11 from 1.34, and it gained thirteen places to 6<sup>th</sup> position. This reflects the addition of 1,144MW of new capacity, mainly in the form of biomass and small hydro, and supportive policies, including net metering and energy auctions.

In contrast, Guatemala’s score plunged on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, and it sank to 26<sup>th</sup> place, having been 4<sup>th</sup> in 2015. Investment of $95m was recorded, down sharply from more than $600m in 2015. 

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country’s score was unchanged at 1.22, which put it in 40<sup>th</sup> place on par with El Salvador and down five from the year before. A few manufacturers and developers are present in the country.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Guatemala’s score rose and it gained two places to 21<sup>st</sup>. Its carbon offsetting activity helped to support its position, which was limited by a lack of carbon policies.
