#### Score Summary

Guatemala scored 1.49 in Climatescope 2016, an increase of 0.09 on its total the year before. It placed 21st overall, down three from its position in the previous survey. The country’s strongest performance by far was on Enabling Framework Parameter I.

Its score on Parameter I increased to 2.11 from 1.34, and it gained thirteen places to 6th position. This reflects the addition of 1,144MW of new capacity, mainly in the form of biomass and small hydro, and supportive policies, including net metering and energy auctions.

In contrast, Guatemala’s score plunged on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, and it sank to 26th place, having been 4th in 2015. Investment of $95m was recorded, down sharply from more than $600m in 2015. 

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country’s score was unchanged at 1.22, which put it in 40th place on par with El Salvador and down five from the year before. A few manufacturers and developers are present in the country.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Guatemala’s score rose and it gained two places to 21st. Its carbon offsetting activity helped to support its position, which was limited by a lack of carbon policies.
