A scarcity of capital, price-distorting subsidies, and political risk combined to make Argentina a relatively unappealing destination for clean energy investment through much of the first half of this decade. That began to change in December 2015 with the arrival of new President Mauricio Macri. Since then, the Macri government has, among other things, sought to cut subsidies and liberalize energy markets to spur conventional and renewable project build underwritten with foreign capital. The country has also set an unconditional long-term target to limit its emissions to 405 MtCO2e by 2030, excluding land use change and forestry (LULUCF).

Most notably, Argentina has set an 8% target for renewable electricity consumption by 2018 and 20% by 2025 under Law 27.191, enacted March 31, 2016. The law represents a landmark for clean energy in the country. In addition to revising and strengthening existing national clean energy consumption targets, it created the Trust Fund for the Development of Renewable Energies (FODER) and provided two tax incentives to boost investments in renewables – a VAT tax rebate and accelerated depreciation. 

Like other nations in Latin America, Argentina has turned to reverse auctions for power contracts to spur the development of clean energy projects. In the second half of 2016, the country hosted RenovAr Round 1 and RenovAr Round 1.5 tenders which between them contracted 2.4GW of new renewable capacity. Winning projects are expected on line 2017-2019. 

These recent clean energy reverse auctions are by no means the first ever held in Argentina. The GENREN tender launched in 2009 received 1.4GW in offers, produced 895MW in contracts signed, but resulted only in 128MW actually getting commissioned. The GENREN experiment went awry when investors balked at backing projects due to concerns over the credit-worthiness of offtaker CAMMESA, and the overall risk perceived to be present in Argentina.

The RenovAr mechanism has sought to address some of the issues that arose out of GENREN. The main move was securing better financial conditions for the auction’s winning bidders through World Bank and FODER guarantees. It aimed to back the offtaker payments and mitigate any systematic risk that may arise throughout the 20-year contract length. Bidders could apply for the guarantees before the two tenders. Additionally, in order to mitigate future transmission constraints, nodes’ capacities and availability were made explicit in the auction rules.

Argentina’s power matrix remains largely reliant on ample local large hydro and natural gas resources. Between them, these two sources account for 75% of capacity and 78% of generation. Oil, coal, and nuclear combined to account for 24% of capacity and 20% of generation.

Renewables are starting to elbow their way onto the grid, however. In 2016, the country generated 2.8TWh from renewables, or 2% of the 137TWh total. Most of this came from small hydro, which accounted for 70% of clean energy generated. Wind, solar, and biomass accounted for the balance.

On biofuels, Argentina enforces 12% biodiesel and 12% ethanol blending mandates for conventional diesel and gasoline, respectively. However, the majority of biodiesel the country produces it exports, to Europe or the U.S. In 2016, Argentina exported 1.6 million tons out of 2.7 million tons produced, up 50% from the prior year. This was largely due to higher demand from the U.S. specifically and greater use of biodiesel generally in public transportation, the local biofuels trade association has said. 

Argentine biodiesel exports have been subject to duties imposed by the EU since May 2013. To support local production, Argentina has boosted its domestic biodiesel blending mandate, raised mandated prices and cut the export tax.

In November 2016, Argentina presented its “Paris” commitment. This included an absolute emissions reduction and pledge to limit emissions to 405 MtCO2e by 2030, excluding land use change and forestry (LULUCF). This unconditional target is equivalent to 22% above the country’s 2010 emissions levels and 74% above 1990 levels. 

Despite Macri government initiatives to boost clean energy and cut emissions, Argentina has a long road ahead to achieve all its targets. Efforts to rebuild international investor confidence are a work in progress. Local transmission and distribution networks stand to inhibit wind and solar build. In short, Argentina has taken important steps to foster its clean energy economy, but plenty of work remains. 
​In recent years, a lack of financing alternatives, distorting subsidies, low power prices and counterparty risk have presented major hurdles to Argentina’s quest for investments in the clean energy sector. With Mauricio Macri’s election as president in December 2015, there is hope for a turnaround.(Insert edit)

Law 27.191, published on 31 March 2016, is the main policy supporting Argentina’s development of renewables. It established the country’s renewables mandate and introduced a feed-in tariff scheme and two tax incentives – a VAT rebate and accelerated depreciation. Law 27.191 set an 8% target for renewable electricity consumption by 2017 and a 20% renewable energy target by 2025.

On biofuels, Argentina enforces a 12% biodiesel- and 12% ethanol-blending mandate for conventional diesel and gasoline, respectively.
In 2015, the country generated 2.6TWh of renewable electricity, equivalent to 2% of the 134TWh generated. Argentina’s power matrix is dominated by fossil-based thermoelectric plants, which accounted for 64% of the total power produced in 2015. Large hydro provided 30% and nuclear contributed 5% of the electricity generated.

In 2009, Argentina contracted renewable capacity through its first and only federal level auction, GENREN. Energías Argentinas SA (ENARSA), a state-owned company active in the hydrocarbon and electricity segments, conducted the auction, and the Secretaria de Energía established regulations. ENARSA awarded 15-year contracts for 895MW of wind, small hydro and solar projects. As of May 2016, only 128MW of those contracted projects had been commissioned.
On 18 May 2016, Argentina’s Ministry of Energy and Mines announced a new renewable power tender to supply the regulated market. It sought 600MW of wind power, more than tripling the 215MW in operation now, and 300MW of solar power, up from almost nothing, as well as 65MW of biomass, 20MW of small hydro power and 15MW of biogas.

Argentina exports most of its biodiesel production. In 2011, it exported 2bn litres out of 2.9bn litres produced, mostly to European Union (EU) countries. In August 2012, the EU initiated an anti-dumping investigation on Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel, which resulted in a 24.6% anti-dumping duty implemented in May 2013. In order to support local production, Argentina increased its biodiesel blending mandate, increased the mandated price and reduced the export tax.


### Score summary

Argentina scored 1.39 in Climatescope 2016, unchanged from the previous year. It dropped six places to rank 26<sup>th</sup> and its best performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country’s score fell and it slid seventeen places to 37<sup>th</sup>. Policies such as the biofuel blending mandate offered a degree of support, but the score was weakened by the absence of any new renewable power generating capacity.

Argentina’s score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II rose slightly and it was placed 50<sup>th</sup>.
This reflected the high average cost of debt (25%) in 2015 and the relatively small volume of new investment ($81m) compared with recent years.

On Parameter III, the country earned 14<sup>th</sup> place thanks chiefly to the large number of clean energy value chains present and the diversity of financial institutions serving the sector.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, Argentina’s score rose and it took 11<sup>th</sup> position. It performed well in the Carbon Offsets and Carbon Policy categories, the latter benefiting from the presence of an emissions reduction target.
