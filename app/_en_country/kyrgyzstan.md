Kyrgyzstan implemented its law on green energy in 2008, establishing payment levels for renewable generation through an application of a premium on the electricity tariffs. However, very low electricity tariffs, as well as existing hurdles in the way of obtaining permits for renewable power projects at a local level and an absence of other support mechanisms, have made capacity additions virtually non-existent. By the end of 2016, the share of non-hydro renewables in total energy consumption was 1.3%, short of the 2013-2017 target of 1.5%. 

In 2016, Kyrgyzstan generated 86% of its power from large hydro, 12% from coal and only 2% from small hydro, currently the only source of renewable energy. The power market in Kyrgyzstan is unbundled, but remains almost 100% state owned, with only two marginal independent power producers and 16 independent distributors with less than 3% market share.  

Kyrgyzstan struggles with power shortages in winter, when the large hydro plants operate at reduced capacity, and oversupply in the summer months. CASA 1000, a new transmission line connecting Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan, will help reduce the oversupply in summer by selling excess generation to Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, the project has been repeatedly delayed. Further, while Kyrgyzstan has a 100% electrification rate, both transmission and distribution lines are outdated and experience common shortages and black-outs. Therefore, most of the foreign aid and financing in the energy sector focuses on rehabilitation of hydropower generation and power networks. 

On 12 December 2012, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved a $20 million loan to Kyrgyzstan for the Kyrgyz Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (KyrSEFF) program. This offers credit lines for the issuing of private and commercial loans to borrowers through local partner banks and micro-finance institutions for energy and resource efficiency improvements. On 14 November 2016, the EBRD approved an additional $35 million for the second phase of the program. In addition to the EBRD financing, the facility will be supported by a grant from the EU through the Investment Facility for Central Asia (IFCA) to fund technical cooperation and incentive payments to sub-borrowers and participating financial institutions. The EU grant is 2-4 million euro in the first phase and 9.2 million euro in the second. KyrSEFF worked well for energy-efficiency projects: rural residents have been making use of the credit line to install mainly efficient heating boilers, cookers and house insulation. However, it has not proved effective for installation of renewable technologies, due to low electricity tariffs.


###Score summary

Kyrgyzstan scored 0.77 in Climatescope 2017, putting it in 59th place worldwide. Within Asia, the country ranked 13th out of the 17 nations assessed, and among the five former Soviet Central Asian Republics (four of which are included in the project for the first time) it was behind only Kazakhstan. Its strongest performance was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

The country’s power sector remains largely state-owned. Privatisation is permitted, but there are high barriers to entry. Generation, transmission and distribution operations have been partially unbundled.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country scored 0.68 and was positioned near the bottom of the global ranking in 66th place overall. Among other things, this reflects the absence of a national clean energy target and subsidies to support growth of the sector. To date, just 39MW of clean energy capacity (small hydro) has been installed. 

Kyrgyzstan also performed poorly on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II. Its score of 0.18 placed it 65th out of the 71 nations assessed. This reflects the absence of any investment in the sector since 2012. International grant and loan programmes are focussed on upgrading the country’s existing grid and large-scale hydro capacity rather than renewables.

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, the country ranked 33rd, placing it within the top 50% of countries assessed. Its score was supported by the presence of a fairly wide variety of service providers and financial institutions serving the clean energy industry.

On Parameter IV, the country also performed strongly, taking 32nd place overall. It signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 and pledged a relatively ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 29% and 30.89% below ‘business as usual’ levels by 2030.
