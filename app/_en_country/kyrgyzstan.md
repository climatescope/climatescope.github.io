Kyrgyzstan implemented its law on green energy in 2008, establishing payment levels for renewable generation through an application of a premium on the electricity tariffs. However, very low electricity tariffs, as well as existing hurdles in the way of obtaining permits for renewable power projects at a local level and an absence of other support mechanisms, have made capacity additions virtually non-existent. By the end of 2016, the share of non-hydro renewables in total energy consumption was 1.3%, short of the 2013-2017 target of 1.5%. 

In 2016, Kyrgyzstan generated 86% of its power from large hydro, 12% from coal and only 2% from small hydro, currently the only source of renewable energy. The power market in Kyrgyzstan is unbundled, but remains almost 100% state owned, with only two marginal independent power producers and 16 independent distributors with less than 3% market share.  

Kyrgyzstan struggles with power shortages in winter, when the large hydro plants operate at reduced capacity, and oversupply in the summer months. CASA 1000, a new transmission line connecting Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan, will help reduce the oversupply in summer by selling excess generation to Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, the project has been repeatedly delayed. Further, while Kyrgyzstan has a 100% electrification rate, both transmission and distribution lines are outdated and experience common shortages and black-outs. Therefore, most of the foreign aid and financing in the energy sector focuses on rehabilitation of hydropower generation and power networks. 

On 12 December 2012, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved a $20 million loan to Kyrgyzstan for the Kyrgyz Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (KyrSEFF) program. This offers credit lines for the issuing of private and commercial loans to borrowers through local partner banks and micro-finance institutions for energy and resource efficiency improvements. On 14 November 2016, the EBRD approved an additional $35 million for the second phase of the program. In addition to the EBRD financing, the facility will be supported by a grant from the EU through the Investment Facility for Central Asia (IFCA) to fund technical cooperation and incentive payments to sub-borrowers and participating financial institutions. The EU grant is 2-4 million euro in the first phase and 9.2 million euro in the second. KyrSEFF worked well for energy-efficiency projects: rural residents have been making use of the credit line to install mainly efficient heating boilers, cookers and house insulation. However, it has not proved effective for installation of renewable technologies, due to low electricity tariffs.
