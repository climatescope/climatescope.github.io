#### Score Summary

Belize scored 1.13 in Climatescope 2016, up from 0.81 the year before. It gained one place to rank 37th on the list of countries overall, and its best performance was on Enabling Framework Parameter I.

The country’s score on Parameter I improved and it jumped thirteen places to rank 14th. Supportive aspects of its policy and regulatory environment include availability of finance and establishment of a national energy target.

Belize’s score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II more than doubled to 0.56, and it rose sixteen places to 28th, despite the absence of any investment in the sector since 2010. The average cost of debt was relatively low at 10.3% in 2015. 

The country’s weakest performance was on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III. It scored 0.46, unchanged from the previous year, and took 55th place, reflecting the scarcity of clean energy companies.

On Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, it ranked 34th, scoring strongly in the Carbon Offsets category but poorly on carbon policy.
