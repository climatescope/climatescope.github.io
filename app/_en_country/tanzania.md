#### Score Summary

Tanzania scored 1.53 in Climatescope 2016, taking 19<sup>th</sup> place on the list of countries overall. It ranked 23<sup>rd</sup> the previous year and 21<sup>st</sup> the year before that. Such consistency belies the marked improvement in the country’s score in 2016, which was mainly due to its good performance on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Tanzania’s score, though only marginally lower, slid fourteen places down the order to 31<sup>st</sup>. The country retains a relatively robust Policy and Regulation category, and is developing a strong distributed generation framework and energy access policies.
 
On Parameter II, the country’s score almost trebled and it gained seventeen places to take 12<sup>th</sup> position. This reflected $130m of investment in the solar sector in 2015, which more than doubled the total committed across all renewable energy sectors since 2010.

The ranking on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III remained unchanged, despite a slight drop in the score due to a decline in the number of distributed clean energy value chains.

The country dramatically improved its score on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, and was propelled thirteen places up the order to 20<sup>th</sup> thanks partly to the introduction of a GHG emissions reduction target.
