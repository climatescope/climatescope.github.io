Thanks to an abundance of large hydroelectric resources, Colombia has historically offered weak policy support to other forms of low-carbon energy. A renewable energy and energy efficiency law enacted in 2014 then amended in 2016 and 2017 stands potentially to change that. However, key questions remain about how effectively this new initiative will be implemented. 

Colombia had a total of 16.5GW capacity installed as of year-end 2016. Large hydro represented 63% of the 66TWh generated in 2016, with natural gas the second largest source with 25%. Other renewables accounted for 5% of generation with most coming from small hydro.

In June 2010, the country set a relatively unambitious target of 6.5% generation from non-large hydro renewables for all those with access to the grid by 2020. For those lacking access, the goal was set at 30%. In addition, Colombia enforces blending mandates of 10% biodiesel in conventional diesel and 10% ethanol in conventional gasoline.

In 2014, Colombia enacted Law 1715, which established legal frameworks and instruments to promote and integrate what it calls “non-conventional” renewables into the grid. This category included biomass and waste, geothermal, small hydro, solar, wind, tidal and wave power. 

The mechanisms for implementing the law’s overall goals were outlined in November 2015. These included income tax exemptions for clean power project owners, accelerated depreciation of clean energy assets, as well as value-added-tax and import-duty exemptions for imported equipment. The government also established a state-run fund specifically for financing clean energy and energy efficiency programs. 

In August 2016, the government published further details on how owners of non-conventional renewables could exploit Law 1715’s subsidies. Then in March 2017, the government approved new legislation to support small and medium-sized renewable energy projects. 
Bringing these policies to life so that they can spur meaningful activity in Colombia has proven elusive, however. The government still has not provided key details on how to apply the incentives and has been slow to put into practice its infrastructure expansion plan through a call for public tenders.

On the international stage, Colombia has committed to cut its CO2 emissions against a business-as-usual (BAU) benchmark that it plans to set for itself. In September 2015, two months prior to the United Nations-sponsored talks in Paris, it submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), committing to cut greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 20% against that projected BAU by 2030. The base case scenario corresponds to 2010 levels.

In its INDC, the government also pledged a further reduction of GHG emissions by 30% below the BAU scenario by 2030. However, this target is conditioned to the direct financial support from wealthier nations. Since 2013, Colombia has been working on developing a system for monitoring, reporting and verification for GHG emission reductions and climate financing. As of May 2017, the country was in the process of defining the objectives, mitigation measures and principles of the system.

In June 2016, Colombia’s Ministry of Mines and Energy (UPME) published a roadmap for directing smart grid investment through 2030. The plan focuses on four areas: smart metering roll-out, distribution automation, distributed energy integration and electric vehicle adoption. UPME anticipates that by 2030 the planned investment will reduce outages from an average of 29.5 hours per year per Colombian household to 5.4 hours.

###Score summary

Colombia scored 1.45 in Climatescope 2016, placing it 22<sup>nd</sup> on the list of 58 countries, down from 19<sup>th</sup>  the previous year. Its score in 2015 was 1.39. The country achieved it highest ranking on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, Colombia’s score made modest gains but it slipped one spot to 27<sup>th</sup>. An additional energy access policy and a modest increase in the volume of installed capacity were supportive factors. 

The country’s score on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II fell slightly, and it slid eleven places to 39<sup>th</sup>. This reflects the absence of new investment in 2015, having seen more than $100m in each of the two preceding years, as well as a slight rise in the average cost of debt. 

On Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III, Colombia’s score rose slightly but its ranking dropped by one place to rank 23<sup>rd</sup>. A wide range of value chains are covered.  

The country’s score on Parameter IV was slightly lower, and it fell two notches to a still-strong 7<sup>th</sup>. It has adopted a broad range of carbon policies and has engaged in considerable carbon offsetting activity.
