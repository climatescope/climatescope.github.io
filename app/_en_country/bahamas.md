#### Score summary

Bahamas gained three places in Climatescope 2016 to take 50th position with a score of 0.75. The countryâ€™s 2015 score was 0.48. Its biggest improvement was on Enabling Framework Parameter I. 

On Enabling Framework Parameter I, the country placed 55th, reflecting the lack of supportive policies, and almost total absence of clean energy development to date.

Bahamas placed 22nd on Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, its highest ranking in this survey. A positive factor was its low (4.75%) average cost of debt.

On Parameter III, the country ranked 53rd, two places down from last year. The sector had just five clean energy value chains and one financial institution.

It took 51st position on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV, a decline from 49th the year before. Among its few attributes in this area is a GHG emissions reduction target.
