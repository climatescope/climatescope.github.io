Ecuador is one of the few countries in Latin America with a feed-in tariff (FiT) in place, although project development has remained slow. 

The original Ecuadorian FiT, which expired in 2012, featured high rates and mostly benefited solar photovoltaic projects. In 2013, a second FiT was launched through regulation 001/13. This time, solar PV was not included, but other technologies may apply.

In Ecuador, the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy (MEER) oversees renewable energy policy and planning. In 2015, the Act Establishing the Public Electric Power Service (LOSPEE) was published, overseeing the power sector in Ecuador. Under this law, the National Electricity Board (CONELEC) becomes the Agency for Regulation and Control of Electricity (ARCONEL). While generation is open to private players in Ecuador, transmission is under the responsibility of state-owned utility Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador (CELEC EP Transelectric). Distribution is divided between 11 majority-public companies, in which MEER is the majority shareholder.

In 2015, Ecuador had a total of 6.2GW of installed capacity, with 56% coming from thermal power and one third from large hydropower. Clean energy, encompassing small hydro, biomass, wind and solar plants, amounted to 11% of total capacity.

In 2011, the government published regulation 004/11, which created and set rates for Ecuador’s first FiT scheme for 15-year contracts. Biomass, geothermal, solar photovoltaic and thermal, wave and tidal and wind plants were included. Photovoltaic plants received the highest tariffs, at $400/MWh. For projects in the Galapagos Islands, a premium was added. The first FiT program contracted a total of 645MW from 111 projects from biomass, small hydro, solar and wind sources. In spite of the incentives, project development has been slow and only a few projects have been commissioned so far. 

Renewable energy developers may also apply for import tax exemption on clean energy equipment and a five-year waiver on income tax. On the transportation side, Ecuador has had a 5% biodiesel blending mandate with conventional diesel since 2013.

The country aims to reach a target of 90% of energy coming from hydroelectric plants in its total electricity production in 2017 and raise the proportion of renewable energy in the energy matrix until 2025. The target is expected to be overachieved due the 1.5GW Coca Codo Sinclair hydro project, the largest generator in the country, which was commissioned in November 2016. In 2015, 55% of its total 23.8TWh was supplied from hydro plants.

On October 13, 2015, the government of Ecuador submitted its unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations, committing to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the energy sector by 20.4%-25% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario by 2025. Ecuador also committed to a further reduction of GHG emissions in the energy sector to a level between 37.5% and 45.8% below the BAU scenario by 2025. This reduction increase is conditioned upon availability of resources and international support.

###Score summary

Ecuador scored 1.19 in Climatescope 2016, an increase of 0.16 on its tally in 2015. It fell four places to 35<sup>th</sup> however, and its best performance was on Greenhouse Gas Management Activities Parameter IV.

The country’s score on Enabling Framework Parameter I increased by 0.25 to 1.49, and it took 22<sup>nd</sup> place, up from 25<sup>th</sup> the previous year. It has adopted a series of clean energy policies that include a biofuel blending mandate and feed-in tariffs. 

On Clean Energy Investment and Climate Financing Parameter II, Ecuador’s score was almost unchanged at 0.45, and it fell ten places to 40<sup>th</sup>.  No new investment was recorded, which stands in contrast to $346m over the preceding four years.
 
Its score on Low-Carbon Business & Clean Energy Value Chains Parameter III was unchanged at 1.04, yet the country fell six places to 45<sup>th</sup>, a relatively poor performance that reflected, among things, a lack of service companies active in the country.
 
On Parameter IV, Ecuador’s score increased by 0.45 to 2.04, placing it 17<sup>th</sup>, a performance that was partly influenced by the introduction of a GHG emissions reduction target.
