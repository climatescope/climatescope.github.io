## COAL IS DEAD. LONG LIVE COAL

Vietnam’s government will need to fuel its industrializing economy with cheap energy. Much of that will come from nearly 40GW of new coal. 

Vietnam’s GDP has expanded 6% annually for the last five years with the industrial sector setting a faster pace with 7% growth. Manufacturing and other heavy industry now contribute nearly 40% to total GDP, almost twice as much as agriculture. This is expected to increase further, especially after Obama’s visit to the country in May, which underlined Vietnam’s trajectory as both consumer and producer in the global market. 

In preparation for its economic transformation, the government released the 2011 Power Development Plan VII (PDP VII) and, more recently, the 2016 revised Power Development Plan VII (revised PDP VII), which outlines the vision for the Vietnamese energy sector. The plan is a boost for renewables. It establishes an increased renewable energy target, a date for a competitive wholesale power market and feed-in-tariffs for wind and biomass (see blog post: The next fifteen years that will (re)define Vietnam’s energy industry). 

The government has also stated that it will no longer issue permits for coal generation. This should be great news for the country’s low-carbon targets, except that is does not pertain to coal projects already permitted in the revised PDP VII. Vietnam plans to build an additional 40GW of new coal, a quadrupling of its current installed base and a quintupling on a generation basis (Figure 1). This is no small matter, especially for a country quickly depleting its cheap domestic coal reserves. Consequently, Vietnam plans to purchase more expensive imported coal from its neighbours and build import facilities in the south connected to ground transportation to the north.  This vast new infrastructure will be built solely for the purpose of distributing cheap coal to electrify industrial areas.

All in all, Vietnam is making impressive progress in its commitment to renewables through its revised power plan and its GHG reduction goals. Yet, at the same time, it has reaffirmed, and perhaps increased, the importance of coal in its future energy matrix.
