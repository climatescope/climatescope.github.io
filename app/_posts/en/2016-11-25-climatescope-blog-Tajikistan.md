## CONNECT FOUR

On May 12, 2016 high government officials of Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Afghanistan gathered in Dushanbe to celebrate the inauguration of Central Asia - South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000).

CASA-1000 is the first stage of the wider strategy to create a Central Asia - South Asia Regional Electricity Market (CASAREM), and is funded by a number of International Development Agencies. With the estimated costs of USD 997 million and involving a construction of 3 converter stations and 1,222 km of high voltage power transmission lines connecting Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Afghanistan, CASA-1000 is an ambitious project. The largest of this nature in the region, it also carries significance due to the cross-border cooperation it promotes.

The project aims to address the unstable energy supply in the region. Rich in hydro resources Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have energy surplus during the summer months when the river flows are at the highest, while experience power cuts in the winter when glaciers are frozen. Neighbouring Pakistan and Afghanistan struggle with chronic energy shortages. In the connected grid, the Central Asia pair will benefit from having access to the energy export market in the summer, and from having revenue to invest into adding capacity facilitating higher domestic power demand in the winter.
Out of the total 1300MW of hydro power planned to be exported, 75% will be supplied by Tajikistan and 25% by Kyrgyzstan. On the receiver side 1,000MW and 300MW will be purchased by Pakistan and Afghanistan respectively.

There are some concerns about the practicality of the project, however. 
Firstly, the two mega hydro power plants, Tajikistan’s Rogun and Kyrgyzstan’s Kambarata, which are to supply the majority of the exported power require major upgrading works. Despite efforts over the recent years, both projects are struggling to attract investors. In Tajikistan, Russian owners of the Santuga 670 MW HPP, which is also to contribute to the connected grid, previously threaten to suspend their services due to frequent non-payments by Tajik state run utility Barki Tojik.
CASA-1000 can help bring political closeness but likewise has a potential to exacerbate the existing tensions. There is an ongoing conflict between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan over the use of water resources. Uzbekistan together with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, neighbouring countries located downstream are questioning the environmental effect the development will have on their water resources. Even the two project allies, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, still haven’t reached an agreement on long standing disputes over the territory split.

On the transmission side - can Afghanistan be a secure transit country for energy infrastructure? Only earlier this year Taliban blew up a major pylon in the Dand-e-Shahabuddin area of Afghanistan, which transmits energy from Uzbekistan to Kabul. 

Finally, corruption is still a factor in both of the exporting countries. Transparent monitoring systems need to be put in place to make sure the revenues gained from summer exports are effectively invested to grow (clean) power generation capacity.
Yet, it is possible to overcome these hurdles through effective cross-border cooperation, and it is hoped that the development of CASA-1000 will trigger this. The project is planned to be completed in 2020 and is supervised by a specially set up Inter-Governmental Council.
