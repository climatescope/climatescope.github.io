## RWANDA 100% CLEAN ENERGY ACCESS PLAN

Over 9m people in Rwanda, 83% of the population, do not have power. We give a scenario for how the country could affordably deliver 100% access with clean electricity. We analyse policy, capacity, costs and investor repayment of this scenario.

Despite impressive economic progress over the past two decades, only 17% of Rwandans have access to electricity. The government is planning significant increases in generating capacity over the next five years, based on a mix of fossil fuels, renewable energy and peat. Once this capacity is built, it will be very difficult to change Rwanda’s energy mix. In this white paper, we outline what it would take for the country to achieve 100% access to 100% clean electricity by 2020, providing significant environmental and climate benefits, while at the same time reducing the country’s import dependence and creating export opportunities for electricity and natural gas.
