## THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS THAT WILL (RE)DEFINE VIETNAM’S ENERGY INDUSTRY

Vietnam has made positive commitments to renewable energy. Its most recent long-term energy plan outlines the Government’s vision for a more diversified energy mix, including 27GW of new renewables by 2030. 

President Obama visited Vietnam in May to promote US-Vietnamese relations and the Trans-Pacific Partnership for open trade -- exciting news for a country already on its way to becoming an industrial power house. Not surprisingly, Vietnam is also well on its way to more than doubling its energy demand over the next decade (Figure 1). This is no coincidence. The Vietnamese government has for years artificially suppressed energy prices to encourage manufacturing and electrification as the population grows. About 98% of Vietnam has access to electricity, with urban areas near 100%. It is worth noting that the state utility, Vietnam Electricity (EVN), will deny that electricity is subsidised. This is true only in that raw fuel such as coal and natural gas are subsidised rather than power generation itself.

As Vietnam enters deeper into the global market, the government can no longer artificially depress coal and gas prices or maintain a monopoly utility. With this in mind, the country has cautiously steered its energy industry towards liberalization and decarbonisation over the last five years. Starting with the 2011 Power Development Plan VII (PDP VII), and with the more recent revised 2016 Power Development Plan VII (revised PDP VII), the country has set out a few impressive goals. 

First and most significant, the revised plan calls for an increased renewable energy target. In terms of renewables as a portion of capacity (and of generation), the plan calls for 10% (6.5%) by 2020, 13% (6.9%) by 2025 and 21% (10.7%) by 2030 (Figure 2).

Second, the plans set technology-specific targets for wind, biomass and, more recently, solar. Vietnam hopes to add 6GW of new wind and 12GW of new solar by 2030 – an exponential increase from its current installed base of ~60MW for both (Figure 3).

Third, the original plan sets out a framework for liberalising the power markets, beginning with a wholesale market by 2021 and later a retail market by 2023. Currently, there is a live pilot for a competitive wholesale market, and a retail version is scheduled for 2021.  This will break the monopoly of the state utility, EVN, and hopefully attract foreign investment into generation assets. 

Fourth, the plan outlines a number of other objectives, including and not limited to: increased investment in north-south transmission lines, feed-in-tariffs for wind and biomass, a target for large-scale hydro, nearly 40GW of new coal, 4.6GW of nuclear and infrastructure for importing coal and LNG. 

In a separate policy, Vietnam has submitted its official INDC emission-reduction goal. The country targets an 8% decrease in emissions by 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario.
