##FINANCING INDIA'S CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION

###<b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b>
India’s energy system faces the triple challenge of meeting growing demand, cutting pollution and offering more than 300m people not connected to the power
grid access to modern energy. The government has set the target of building 175GW of renewable energy by 2022, primarily solar and wind, and mandated the rapid electrification of more than 18,000 villages. If realised, this presents an investment opportunity of more than $150bn in clean power generation.
• India's renewable energy sector can be divided into four distinct categories, namely utility-scale projects (>1MW), small and rooftop solar (1kW - 1MW) projects, small energy grids (100W-50kW) and solar home systems and lanterns (<100W). The current situation and the path forward for these are summarised below.

####<b>Utility-scale projects</b>
• Installed capacity: at the end of FY2016, the country had 42.6GW of installed renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) – representing 14% of total generation capacity – and 2016 is on track to become the best year for renewable installations. The sector is not only drawing Indian firms but also foreign utilities. Power generation companies particularly from Europe and Asia are increasing their presence through greenfield investments or acquisitions.
