## TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO GRID HAS GONE BEFORE: THE COMPELLING CASE FOR OFF-GRID POWER IN MOZAMBIQUE

Whilst transmission woes are far from unique to Mozambique amongst its neighbours in Africa, what stands as a major obstacle to utility-scale development spells out a convincing case for the viability of off-grid solutions to electrification. 

What does set Mozambique apart from its neighbours is the way in which its national grid was developed – in three separate systems: Northern, Central and Southern. Whilst there is some interconnection between the Northern and Central grids, there is no domestic interconnection between the Southern grid (which serves the capital, Maputo) and the rest of the national grid (where the majority of generation capacity is located). In order to transmit power to the Southern grid, electricity from the Cahora Bassa hydro project is wheeled through South Africa. Whilst this is a solution that is effective in maintaining the status quo, the lack of transmission infrastructure in Mozambique presents a major obstacle to the development of a substantial utility-scale clean energy sector. 

Whilst the development of a transmission line connecting the southern grid to the central and northern grids is under way, progress has been slow. Developers would be forgiven for any pessimism on their parts when evaluating the risks of the grid connection process.

Figure 1 plots electrification rates against population density for all of the sub-Saharan African countries covered by Climatescope, in order to get a sense of the relative potential of off-grid solutions to increasing electrification rates in African countries. As evident from this graph, Mozambique has a low electrification rate and low population density relative to other sub-Saharan African countries – this implies a bigger potential market for off-grid solutions, as grid extensions to connect the unelectrified population to the grid would be significantly more expensive on a per capita basis than in countries with higher population density.

Figure 2 plots the electrification rate in rural areas against the size of the rural population for the sub-Saharan African countries covered by Climatescope – whilst Figure 1 served as a measure of the potential for off-grid solutions to increasing electrification rates, Figure 2 shows how the size of these potential markets. As evident from this chart, Ethiopia, the DRC, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Mozambique are all characterised by a combination of extremely low rates of rural electrification and large rural populations. 

Moving towards the future, as African states strive for universal electricity access, off-grid solutions pose an attractive alternative to expensive grid expansions. With a large rural population, an undeveloped and unconnected national grid and a low electrification rate, Mozambique looks like it could be one of the largest potential markets for off-grid solutions.
