## THE TARIFFS THAT NOBODY WANTED

Vietnam will not be able to attract foreign private investment without first establishing sufficient financial incentives. Without this first step, it will be difficult for the country to meet its target of 27GW of renewable capacity by 2030. 

Feed-in-tariffs (FiT) in Vietnam are too low to incentivise new build, and optimism that the government will increase rates above costs is fading. This is the most significant policy obstacle to renewable penetration and a point of contention between major stakeholders, that is, the state utility, Vietnam Electricity (EVN), and private developers eager to expand into the market. EVN is cash-strapped and is opposed to higher power contracts. On the other side, private developers are eager for favourable rates to jump-start investment but can’t find financing under current terms. 

Simply said, rates are too cheap. This is measured by comparing FiTs to the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), a proxy for a contract rate that offers adequate project returns (Figure 1). 

1.	The avoided-cost-tariff provides an average rate of $30/MWh for all renewables connected to the grid. It applies to multiple technologies but is only adequate for small hydro, and only for the best performing projects at $24/MWh. 

2.	The biomass FiT at $48/MWh is below the best-case LCOE of $80/MWh. Consequently, there are 150MW of stranded projects that have mostly operate off-grid for heating. It has also stalled a pipeline of nearly 400MW of permitted projects. 

3.	The wind FiT at $78/MWh is far below best-case LCOE of $96/MWh. Only 56MW of wind have been built but none use the official FiT.  Rather, developers negotiated one-off bilateral contracts with more favourable terms. Private developers and NGOs such as GIZ and the World Bank have repeatedly called for this tariff to be raised to $90-110/MWh to spur growth and meet the country’s goal of installing 6GW of new wind.  

4.	There is a proposal to establish a PV FiT of $110-140/MWh. As of June 2016, there has been no progress.
