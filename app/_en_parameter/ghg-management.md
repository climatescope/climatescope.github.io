 ## <strong>PARAMETER IV – GREENHOUSE GAS MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES</strong>

Greenhouse Gas Management Activities-Parameter IV takes into account carbon offset project activity, level of policy support for carbon emissions reduction, and local corporate awareness of carbon issues through a total of 13 indicator inputs. Parameter IV contributed 15% toward each nation’s overall score.

Relevant indicators are arranged into three categories: Carbon Offsets, Carbon Policy and Corporate Awareness. The Carbon Offset category measures what countries have done to develop offset projects and their potential to continue into the future. It holds the greatest weight toward the overall Parameter IV score at 40%. The other two categories account for 30% apiece. 

It is worth noting that Climatescope methodology does not measure countries’ emissions or reduce their scores when these are high. Rather, it seeks to take into account efforts launched explicitly to reduce future emissions.

### KEY FINDINGS

Across all 58 Climatescope nations, the average Parameter IV score ticked up to 1.56 from 1.36 in 2015 and 1.34 in 2014. This increase is generally explained by the fact that the majority of countries submitted greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets as Intended National Determined Contributions (INDC) in advance of the COP21 meeting in Paris in December 2015. Assuming countries follow through on promises to improve their mitigation efforts and carbon policies, further score improvements may be expected in coming years.  The critical importance of climate change mitigation policies in Climatescope countries is highlighted by the fact that these nations accounted for just over half of total GHG emissions worldwide and China alone for just under a quarter in 2012, the latest year for which complete data exists (Figure 1).

More importantly, Climatescope countries are where emissions are projected to grow most from their current levels as they encompass some of the fastest growing economies in the world.  India for example is expected to more than double its GHG emissions by 2030 under current policy projections. Hence the support of carbon reduction activities in Climatescope countries must be a cornerstone of global climate change mitigation efforts. 

#### INTENDED NATIONAL DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (INDC)

In 2015, countries submitted their INDCs to the United Nations to communicate steps they plan to take to address climate change. INDCs include emission reduction targets which can be conditional upon support of the international community, unconditional, or a combination of both. Participation among the 58 Climatescope countries was broad, with 43 nations submitting their INDCs with emission reduction targets (Figure 2). The targets include three types of commitments: 

*	<strong>Absolute targets</strong> relative to total actual emissions in a base year and therefore a commitment to an absolute reduction. Six Climatescope countries submitted absolute targets.
