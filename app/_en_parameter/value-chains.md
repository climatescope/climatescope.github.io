## PARAMETER III – VALUE CHAINS

This parameter employs three indicators to measure local value chain resources available to facilitate clean energy deployment. These seek to take into account the availability of local manufacturers to provide the equipment needed to construct projects, financial firms to provide capital, and service firms to provide assistance such as legal support or other services. 
For the least developed, “off-grid” nations in the survey, this parameter used the augmented off-grid focus methodology to take into account the availability of technical assistance and service providers in value chains specifically related to distributed clean energy. In all, Climatescope sought to account for no less than 63 value chain segments for the on-grid nations and 78 for those in the off-grid category. Parameter III contributed 15% toward each nation’s overall score.
It is important to note that Parameter III measures where certain value chain segments are present. It does not take into account the volume of actual output occurring locally.

### KEY FINDINGS

Climatescope 2016 confirmed that expanding manufacturing chains in the survey’s nations is a slow and laborious process. The average score among all Climatescope nations on Parameter III inched up to 1.98 from 1.96 in last year’s study and 1.94 the year prior. Of the 24 nations that managed to raise their Parameter III scores, half added just a single link to their local value chains. 

#### TECHNOLOGY TRENDS 

Progress on value chains since Climatescope 2013 has been the strongest for wind, solar and geothermal (Figure 29). Wind and solar have by far been the most dynamic technologies in terms of new investment (see Parameter II summary). The spread and coverage of the geothermal value chain is the lowest of all technologies. This is linked to the fact that resources are spread less evenly than for other renewables and that the upfront cost of developing the sector is higher.
