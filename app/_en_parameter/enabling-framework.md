## PARAMETER I – ENABLING FRAMEWORK

Climatescope’s Enabling Framework Parameter I includes a total of 22 indicators, which assess a country’s policy and power sector structure, levels of clean energy penetration, level of price attractiveness for clean energy deployment, and the expectations for how large the market for clean energy can become. Parameter I took into account a wide variety of indicators to compile a final score. This ranged from the macro in the form of overall policy scores for a country’s clean energy policy regime, to the micro in the form of kerosene or diesel prices for lesser developed nations. Parameter I contributed 40% toward each nation’s overall score. For more on how this parameter and others were compiled, please see the complete Climatescope methodology.

### KEY FINDINGS

Climatescope 2016 tracked notable improvements in the enabling framework conditions of the majority of countries reviewed. No fewer than 46 of the 55 countries reviewed in Climatescopes 2015 and 2016 saw their Parameter I scores rise year-over-year.  By comparison, in the 2015 survey, only 26 countries showed improvements from the prior year. 

Not only did the number of countries who saw progress rise, but the average degree of improvement also jumped. The average per-country gain on Parameter 1 from 2015-2016 was twice as high as from 2014-2015 and, for that matter, from 2013-2014. 

The two specific areas where countries demonstrated progress were on strengthened clean energy policy frameworks and power market structures. Climatescope tracked 28 countries in which laws or regulations were enhanced to better support renewables. The survey also counted 15 countries that achieved progress in liberalizing power market conditions, often through the unbundling of state-run utilities. 

This year’s Climatescope analysed for the first time three nations in the Middle East and North Africa region – Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon. The three achieved mixed results.  Jordan made it to the top 4 with a score of 2.31 out of a possible 5 and ranked11thoverall. For their part, Egypt and Lebanon scored 1.03 and 0.87, respectively reflecting challenging socio-economic and security conditions in those nations in recent years.
