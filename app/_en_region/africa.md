## AFRICA & THE MIDDLE-EAST

### SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAâ€™S GENERATION CAPACITY GAP 

Of the three regions surveyed in Climatescope, Sub-Saharan Africa has by far the least installed generation capacity per capita, highlighting severe shortages and massive unmet demand (Figure 37). In all, the 19 Climatescope countries in the region had a total installed capacity of just over 86GW in 2015, 4.6GW of which are renewables.  By comparison, the United Kingdom has over 90GW of total capacity installed and the US over 1,000GW installed.
