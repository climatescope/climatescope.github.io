## ASIA

Asia, led by China and India, installed far more clean energy capacity in 2015 than the other two regions surveyed by Climatescope. China is of course at the heart of this and it posted another record year despite being in the midst of far-reaching power sector reforms. Taking a cue from Germany and others, China now plans to transition away from fixed tariff-based mechanisms toward market-based incentives for renewables. This follows the trend seen in India where auctions have allowed the procurement of new solar PV capacity at record-low prices. 

The growth of renewables has, however, not been free of challenges in China and India. Both are grappling with integrating this new, clean, but variable resource. Each are also confronting costs associated with subsidy programmes.

Other Climatescope Asia countries were hardly idle in 2015 though their performances are undeniably overshadowed by the region’s two giants. New and important steps were taken to improve market conditions for renewables in a number of these countries, such as measures to improve access to capital for developers. Other efforts have targeted fossil fuel or retail power price subsidies, which can make it challenging for renewables to compete. Support across the region continues to grow for distributed generation, particularly as prices for PV equipment continue to sink. Typically, these have taken the form of new net metering and investment subsidies. 

Nonetheless, key issues continue to pose significant obstacles to clean energy’s long-term growth in Asia.  Integration problems have led to severe episodes of curtailment with generators suffering from lost associated revenue.  The financial well-being of local utilities (power distribution companies) continues to be in doubt, posing credit risks for developers looking to bring new projects on line. Finally, there are subsidies for retail electricity or fossil fuels, which are politically difficult to remove but fundamentally undermine the economics of renewables. 

### RENEWABLE ENERGY CAPACITY GROWTH IS UNEVEN

In 2015, Asian nations surveyed in Climatescope set an annual record for new clean energy capacity added. No less than 62GW of wind, solar, small hydro and biomass plants were commissioned during the year – up 60% from 2014. Today, these countries are home to 308GW of renewable energy capacity, equivalent to France and Germany’s combined total installed capacity.

Still, deployment has been unevenly split across the region. China, the world’s second biggest economy, has embarked on what is by far the largest renewables deployment programme in history. It accounted for 90% of the region’s new clean energy generation capacity installed in 2015. India was a distant second with 9% (5.6GW), mostly from wind and solar plants. China and India have seen renewable energy capacity installations grow every year since 2013, with onshore wind representing the bulk of the activity but solar accelerating considerably recently (Figure 1).

Installations in the rest of the Asian countries reviewed by Climatescope have been more irregular, although total new solar and wind have grown each year since 2011(Figure 2). Pakistan saw the biggest uptick in 2015 with 758MW of mostly wind and solar, approximately five times what got built the prior year. Further deployment is set to continue thanks to new support made available by the Pakistani government in 2015, some of which is support by China [(for more, click here to read the Pakistan country profile).] (Add hyperlink)

Vietnam and Tajikistan have doubled their small hydro capacity from 2010 to 2015 while Sri Lanka and Nepal increased theirs by around a third. Finally, Nepal and Bangladesh have made important progress in off-grid clean energy, which is not accounted for in Figure 2, which shows only utility-scale activity.

### INVESTMENT IS SPREADING TO PAKISTAN

In 2015, the Climatescope Asia countries secured $127bn in clean energy investment, or 82% of what was deployed in the 58 nations surveyed. Asia is the only region where investment has grown every year since 2011.

China and India in 2015 remained the first and second largest renewable investment destinations, respectively, and continued to see capital flows grow steadily (Figure 3). For the first time, solar surpassed wind by attracting $64bn, or just over half of total investment. Bioenergy and small hydro have seen their shares shrink in recent years and accounted for a combined $6bn in 2015 (Figure 4).

Away from India and China, other Asian nations saw a stark investment drop led by a fall of investment in geothermal projects. Total capital deployed in these countries fell by more than half, from $2.8bn to $1.3bn (Figure 5 and Figure 6). 

Pakistan and Vietnam continued to raise their profiles with investors in 2015. Capital deployed doubled from $360m to $719m in Pakistan. In Vietnam, investment spiked to $280m in 2015 from $91m the prior year. 

Indonesia, which had one of the highest levels of investment across all Climatescope countries in 2014 with $1.8bn slipped to $308m in 2015. Indonesia’s headline figure was substantially boosted in 2014 by the $1.6bn Chevron Gunung Salak 330MW geothermal plant.

On the technology front, solar struggled to exceed 200MW installed in non-China/India Climatescope Asia nations once again in 2015 (Figure 6). However, the spread of projects has improved. In 2014, 98% of solar PV project financings occurred in Pakistan. In 2015, Pakistan still lead with just over half of investments into solar but Vietnam took a third and Indonesia the rest. Vietnam and Pakistan are the only countries in which onshore wind projects was financed, confirming their leading role in this sector amongst this sub-group of Climatescope Asia countries. Other countries in the region saw no financings of utility-scale assets in 2015; however Nepal and Bangladesh continue to have activity in off-grid renewables.
