## LATIN AMERICA & THE CARIBBEAN

Latin American countries continue to be at the forefront in clean energy development among the nations assessed in Climatescope. Ambitious clean energy mandates and aggressive auctions are driving deployment in the region and allowing wind and solar projects to achieve record low prices. Markets are opening to new opportunities and engagements with the private sector. Investment is reaching new records and markets are adopting innovative finance instruments, like green bonds. Clean energy is opening new frontiers for service providers and equipment manufacturers, expanding the reach of the industry. 

Still, the nascent industry faces challenges. Policymakers and energy planning agencies must adjust to the new dynamics presented by renewable projects. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are learning to navigate macroeconomic and project-level risks. Investors and financiers are adapting to clean energy projects-specific requirements. 

This marks the first Climatescope in which Brazil has not secured the top ranking in the Latin America and Caribbean region. The country’s score is up over last year, but did not rise at the pace of some other Latin America and Caribbean nations. While Brazil remains one of the top 10 global clean energy markets, its macroeconomic and political crisis has taken a significant toll on its renewable energy industry. 

This year, for the first time, Chile occupies the first position in Latin America, mainly due to record investment, which jumped from $1.3bn in 2014 to $3.2bn in 2015. Renewables have had a big impact on Chile’s power sector, contributing to a drop of wholesale prices, but also aggravating transmission congestion issues. With Brazil ranked second, Uruguay rounds out the top three thanks to high participation of renewables in the country’s matrix. Uruguay’s clean energy market is to a large degree now saturated, but the country still has plenty of work ahead in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. 

### RENEWABLE ENERGY CAPACITY 

Latin America and the Caribbean boasts higher clean energy penetration than any region assessed in Climatescope. As of year-end 2015, 12% of the 366GW installed in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) was represented by biomass, wind, small hydro, solar and geothermal power-generating projects. These sources accounted for 10% of total installed capacity in the Asian countries covered by Climatescope, 3% in African countries and less than 1% in Middle Eastern and North African (MENA)<sup>1</sup> nations.  If we include large hydro in the mix, 56% of Latin America’s power grid is renewable. However, hydro generation overreliance has brought issues to several countries in the region.

Historically, Brazil, Costa Rica, Uruguay and Panama have all suffered from droughts that have put their power matrices under severe stress. Most recently, Colombia and Venezuela faced crisis due to lower than expected hydro generation. 

All of this has moved countries to contemplate energy diversification and support development of non-hydro renewables. This trend has accelerated in 2014 (Figure 1 and Figure 2). And in 2015, wind, solar, small hydro, geothermal and biomass plants accounted for half of the 13GW of new capacity added in the region. The bulk came from wind (4.1GW), mostly in Brazil (2.6GW), Mexico (769MW), Uruguay (376MW) and Panama (150MW) and the market is expected to continue growing. In the next five years, BNEF expects 22.5GW of new wind to be added in Latin America.

Solar projects still represent just a small share of commissioned capacity in the region, but this expected to change in coming years. BNEF foresees 9GW of utility-scale PV to be installed in Latin America between 2016 and 2018. 

Despite the relatively small figures, 2015 set a record for PV capacity added at 0.9GW. Over 40% of that came in tiny Honduras driven by a generous feed-in tariff of $180/MWh for plants commissioned by 31 July 2015. Chile was second with 305MW of solar added.

### RENEWABLE ENERGY TARGETS

Latin America and Caribbean governments are stepping up support for clean energy. In 2015, the number of nations with renewable energy targets nearly doubled compared to the year before and included 18 of 26 surveyed for Climatescope in the region. This is up from just 10 countries in 2014. One of the drivers: the Paris agreement and the Intended National Determined Contributions (INDC) submitted to the United Nations in 2015. 

Still, targets, compliance and ambition vary substantially between countries. Brazil is sticking to its conservative target as renewables uptake has been extremely successful to date. Peru on the other hand has failed to review its renewable portfolio standard, despite the fact it essentially expired in 2013. Nicaragua has the extremely ambitious target of having renewables account for 91%of consumption by 2027 (up from 50% in 2015). 

Finally, there are a number of countries where clean energy development has far exceeded original national targets. Uruguay, for instance, aimed to reach 15% of clean energy installed capacity by 2015 but more than doubled that to 34% last year. The country now aims to meet up to 38% of its electricity needs with wind energy alone by 2017. 

### CLEAN ENERGY POLICY 

Latin America has led the world in its use of auctions to contract clean energy capacity and generation. Back in 2009, Brazil was one of the first to adopt auctions to contract renewables. At the time, this was novel compared to feed-in tariff schemes used in a number of European countries. Today, a total of 13 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have adopted auctions and tenders as the main way to contract clean power – a trend that is also spreading globally (see Parameter I summary). 

Auctions have been successful in fostering clean energy deployment because they provide long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) at a set rate. Clean energy projects are very capital-intensive at the development stage. Long-term contracts provide revenue certainty that help developers to reduce project risk and improve financing conditions. More importantly, auctions introduce a competitive element that pushes developers to deliver the best price possible. This has led to steep price declines across the region as developers fight for contracts. 

However, auction mechanisms must be closely watched for irrational bidding or, worse still, market rigging. Brazil saw the former with its 2014 solar-specific auctions. Developers bid very aggressively for contracts, offering prices which at the time were feasible but would generate for them only very tight returns. 

Shortly thereafter, the Brazilian economy went into a tailspin and its currency collapsed vs. the dollar.  Developers that would have achieved narrow returns suddenly found themselves with projects and contracts that could not produce profits. Brazil stands as a cautionary tale of how market conditions can rapidly shift and catch developers – and policy-makers – off guard.

Similar risks could be taken into account in other nations with potentially volatile macroeconomic environments. In this respect, the recent trend toward allowing power purchase agreements to be signed in dollars is a welcome move. 

While utility-scale clean energy installations are driven by auctions, net metering policies are helping the nascent Latin American distributed generation market grow. Net metering regulation has significantly increased in the region in the past two years. Currently, 11 countries have net metering policies in place, compared to just seven in 2013. 

The benefits of self-generation policies are clearly seen in island nations heavily-dependent on fossil fuels for energy generation but also with high solar irradiation. Four of the six Caribbean islands reviewed in Climatescope have net metering policies in place. This figure is also high in Central America where four of seven countries have self-generation policies enacted, but low in South America where Brazil, Chile and Uruguay are the only markets in which users are allowed to sell their excess generation to the grid.

### EMISSIONS’ REDUCTION TARGETS

Compelled by the Paris talks, last year 24 Latin America and Caribbean countries submitted plans to the UN to address climate change. Among these, 20 included specific greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets, which are split in three types of commitments:

* <strong>Absolute targets</strong> are relative to real emissions in a base year and therefore are a commitment to an absolute reduction. Brazil and Costa Rica submitted absolute targets. Brazil, for instance, has committed to cut greenhouse gas emissions 37% below 2005 levels by 2025. 
* <strong>Intensity targets</strong> are relative to GHG emissions per unit of GDP. Chile and Uruguay submitted intensity targets. Chile, for instance, has committed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by GDP unit by 30% below the 2007 level by 2030. We estimate that this will result in over 50% growth in emissions over the same period. 
* <strong>Business as usual targets (BAU) </strong> are relative to a BAU scenario, which is projected considering future economic and population growth and therefore result in increase in emissions in absolute terms (Figure 3). 16 Latin America and Caribbean countries surveyed in Climatescope submitted BAU targets. Haiti, for instance, has committed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5% below the BAU by 2030. This implies an absolute increase in emissions of 149% by the target year. Targets can be conditional, unconditional or a combination of both. Conditional commitments are subject to international support while unconditional commitments rely on domestic resources alone. Nine countries in the region have disclosed detailed unconditional and conditional targets (Figure 3).
