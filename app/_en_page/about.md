Climatescope is a unique country-by-country assessment, interactive report and index that evaluates the investment conditions for clean energy and climate-related investments worldwide.

It profiles 71 countries worldwide and evaluates their ability to attract capital for low-carbon energy sources while building a greener economy.

Climatescope is a snapshot of where clean energy policy and finance stand today, and a guide to what can happen in the future.

This marks the sixth year of the Climatescope project. In 2012 and 2013, Climatescope focused exclusively on Latin America and the Caribbean. The first edition was developed by the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank Group in partnership with Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

From 2014 to 2016, the UK Department for International Development and the US Agency for International Development  joined as supporters and advisors. The project was expanded to include 58 countries, states, and provinces in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.  The coverage was expanded further to include three countries from the Middle-East and North Africa, as well as with an updated methodology for the off-grid energy coverage.

In the last year, Climatescope has expanded to include 13 additional countries in Central Europe and Asia, bringing the total number of countries to 71. The project is supported by the UK Department for International Development, and Bloomberg New Energy Finance serves as research partner and author of the report.
